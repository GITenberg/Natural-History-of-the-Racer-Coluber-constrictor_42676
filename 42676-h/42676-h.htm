<p class="caption2"><a name="Introduction" id="Introduction"></a>Introduction</p>


<p>Throughout much of the United States the racer is abundant and
is one of the snakes best known to man. Its active diurnal habits
and its preference for a habitat in meadows, pastures, and hayfields
rather than in remote wilderness areas, result in frequent encounters
with humans. The racer is a predator on many kinds of small
animals, both vertebrates and invertebrates; it takes as food chiefly
animals that are agricultural pests but also destroys some beneficial
kinds. Yet, in general, the attitudes of rural people toward the racer
are little influenced by these economic and ecologic considerations,
but rather, are dominated by an unreasonable fear, despite the
racer's inoffensive disposition, and inability to inflict any harm on
humans.</p>

<p>Although an extensive literature exists regarding the racer, no
thorough study of the species' natural history has been made heretofore.
Obviously such study is needed. Few species of vertebrates
having comparable economic bearing have been similarly neglected.
In 1948, undertaking a program of ecological research on the
recently created University of Kansas Natural History Reservation,
I included the racer among the many common species studied to
gain insight into the functioning of the local ecosystem. Live-trapping
of snakes on the area was begun in 1949, and these operations
were greatly intensified in the years 1957 through 1962, with
efforts concentrated on the study of the racer in the 1960, 1961 and
1962 seasons. Thus my study is based upon 14 consecutive years'
records on the Reservation, the northeasternmost section in Douglas
County, Kansas, six and one-half miles north northeast of the University
of Kansas campus at Lawrence. After the acquisition in
1956 of the 160-acre Rockefeller Tract adjacent to the Reservation
on the north in Jefferson County, field work was extended to this
new area, which, because it was superior habitat, in the final years
of the study produced more records than the Reservation. An
important but relatively minor segment of the data originated from
Harvey County Park, 13 miles west of Newton, Kansas, where
lines of live-traps were maintained in 1959, 1960, 1961, 1962.
Smaller collections of data were obtained from the Lalouette Ranch
in the Flint Hills, three miles northeast of Florence, Marion County,
Kansas, and from Cedar Bluff Reservoir, 23 miles west and seven
miles south of Hays in Trego County, western Kansas, where live-trapping
was carried on in 1959 and 1960. Additional data were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
obtained on numerous field trips to various collecting localities in
northeastern Kansas. My first-hand knowledge of the species is also
based, in part, on many years of field experience with the far
western subspecies <i>C. c. mormon</i> in western Oregon and California,
and on similar experience in 1947 and 1948 with the southern subspecies,
<i>C. c. anthicus</i> in central Louisiana.</p>

<p>This varied field experience with the species at localities well
scattered throughout its geographic range has added perspective
to the study even though most of the records were collected within
a radius of three quarters of a mile. No one locality can be regarded
as entirely typical of a species' habitat over its range as a
whole. According to my philosophy, the ecological niche of a
species is subject to geographical variation analogous to the variation
to be seen in the morphological characters of the animal itself.
Different community associates, including different competitors,
prey, and predators, and different physical factors enforce a somewhat
different way of life on a species in geographically remote
parts of its range. When analyzed these differences often turn out
to have a genetic basis. Thus, limits of tolerance to heat, cold, and
drought often vary geographically, and the population density,
reproductive potential, seasonal cycle, and other properties of
populations may be altered either by the direct effect of the environment,
or through its effect on the genetic constitution, produced
by natural selection.</p>

<p>The local population of racers studied was near the center of the
species' geographic range, and is to some extent representative of
the species as a whole, though differing in its ecology from other
populations in proportion to their remoteness and the distinctness
of their habitats. It has not been demonstrated that ecological
traits of populations change in a discontinuous manner or correspond
in their limits with those of named subspecies. More likely
geographical variation is continuous and parallels morphological
variation only in a general way. Certainly the boundaries of subspecies'
ranges should not be accorded undue emphasis in an
ecological study.</p>

<p>My investigation of the blue racer under natural conditions, combined
with a compilation and analysis of published literature, has resulted
in a fairly satisfactory understanding of some phases of the
species' ecology and natural history, such as the food habits, the
growth rate, the extent of home range and of seasonal movements.
However, relatively little was learned concerning some phases of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
the life history. Unfortunately, the traps used did not catch young
of the smaller sizes. Facts concerning egg-laying, incubation, and
hatching therefore are known chiefly from snakes kept in confinement.
Although first-year young were captured by hand from time
to time they were obtained in relatively small numbers, and little
was learned regarding their population density, movements, or
mortality factors. Of course, such hiatuses are to be expected; even
in man such enigmas as the disparate sex ratio still challenge the
investigator.</p>

<p>For the subspecies of racer involved in my field study the widely
used vernacular "blue racer" has been adopted in this report. In
general I advocate conformity with the vernacular names published
by the Committee on Herpetological Common Names (1956).
However, in this list, the name blue racer was assigned to <i>Coluber
constrictor foxi</i>, an invalid subspecies of the Prairie Peninsula that
has been relegated (Auffenberg, 1955:92; Smith, 1961:196) to the
synonymy of <i>C. c. flaviventris</i>. It therefore seems appropriate that
the book name "yellow-bellied racer" applied to <i>flaviventris</i> by the
Committee should be abandoned for this subspecies, and that the
name blue racer be applied officially, as it is in actual practice by
both laymen and herpetologists, to all populations of this subspecies.</p>

<p>Financial assistance from the National Science Foundation in
1957 through 1962 is acknowledged. Although none of the three
separate grants involved was made specifically for the autecological
study of the racer, all three contributed to the support of the
extensive program of live-trapping for snakes, which yielded most
of the records upon which this report is based. Student assistants
who were employed on these projects include James W. Bee,
William N. Berg, Donna M. Hardy, Robert M. Hedrick, Dale Hoyt,
Robert M. Packard, Robert G. Webb, and Wayne Wiens, at the
Reservation; Roy Henry, Dale Horst, Dwight R. Platt, and Howard
L. Schrag at Harvey County Park, and Gilbert L. Adrian at Cedar
Bluff Reservoir. Dr. Edwin P. Martin, formerly of Fort Hays, Kansas
State College, was helpful in planning and carrying out the
field work at Cedar Bluff Reservoir. Eric Shulenberger assisted
with field work and processing of data in 1962 under the National
Science Foundation program for Undergraduate Research Participation.
Robert Miner assisted with the examination of specimens in
1960. Mr. August Lalouette of Florence, Kansas, permitted field
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
work on his ranch and contributed information and materials to
expedite this work. Mr. and Mrs. Harold Brune of Route 3,
Lawrence, Kansas, kindly contributed several clutches of racer eggs
found on their farm in Jefferson County, and also made available
significant information accompanying them. Dr. William H. Stickel
kindly made available at my request records of predation on racers
from the food habits files of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
Dr. William E. Duellman of the University of Kansas Museum of
Natural History and Dr. Robert C. Stebbins of the University of
California Museum of Vertebrate Zoology kindly permitted examination
and dissection of specimens in the collections under their care.
Dr. George W. Byers of the University of Kansas Department of
Entomology identified numerous insects eaten by racers. My
daughter, Alice V. Fitch, often assisted me with the field work and
the processing of data. My wife, Virginia R. Fitch, read the manuscript
critically, assisted me with the examination of museum specimens,
and with typing, and helped in various other ways.</p>

<p>This investigation was based primarily on the capture in live-traps,
marking, release, and recapture of blue racers in their natural
habitat. On the combined area of the Reservation and the Rockefeller
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
Experimental Tract, 1020 blue racers were recorded a total
of 1688 times from August 30, 1948, to October 27, 1962. At
Harvey County Park 361 blue racers were marked, and were
captured a total of 467 times from May 6, 1959, to September 14,
1962, and at Cedar Bluff Reservoir 42 were captured from May 11,
1959, to June 30, 1960.</p>

<p>The traps used were cylinders of galvanized wire, "hardware
cloth" (Fitch, 1951:77; 1960:77), having funnels opening into each
end, or having a funnel at one end and a plug at the other. The
traps, open at both ends, were used along hilltop rock ledges where
an exposed vertical rock face provided a barrier along which a
snake might travel and where it could be easily intercepted by the
trap without any accessory equipment (see <a href="#Plate_21">Pl. 21, Fig. 1</a>). Where
such natural barriers were lacking, as in level fields, barriers consisting
of boards, screens or sheet metal were installed to guide the
racer toward the trap and into a funnel entrance. Two such barriers
at each end of a trap forming a V to guide the snake into the funnel
were used in 1956 and 1957, when trapping at places away from
the hibernation ledges was undertaken. Later it was found simpler
and more effective to use a single barrier with a trap at each end.
The barrier extended up into the funnel entrance, and usually the
racer, following along the barrier on either side, would pass into the
funnel and through its apex. However, it was possible for a racer
to travel around the end of the barrier without entering the trap,
and perhaps some did so.</p>

<p>The need for making the barrier and trap a tight unit impassable
to the snake, was somewhat counterbalanced by the need for having
the whole installation loosely constructed so that it could be
easily altered, opened, adjusted, and cleaned. Since the traps were
kept set in large numbers, and the task of checking them was time-consuming,
speed of operation was more important than the perfect
functioning of any one trap. Approximately 200 traps were kept
set when operations were at their maximum. No record was kept
of the number of "trap days" involved in the study, but the total
was well over 100,000 for the Reservation and the Rockefeller Tract.
When traps were set at both ends of a barrier, the outer end of
each trap was closed with a plug. No bait was used in the traps.
Occasionally small vertebrates and insects of kinds used as food by
the racers may have gotten caught first and served to attract the
snakes. Best catches of racers were made in the breeding season,
since males were attracted by females already in the traps, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
several males might be captured simultaneously with one female.
Occasionally as a person approached or handled a trap, a racer
darted out of it, displaying a perception, acuity of vision, and skill
in avoiding the inward projecting wire prongs encircling the small
funnel opening, that were exceptional among the several species
of snakes trapped. Doubtless many other racers that were caught
in traps escaped before they were discovered. If the funnel entrance
of the trap was of the same diameter as the snake itself, or only a
little larger, there was little likelihood of the trapped racer escaping.
However, funnel openings were usually adjusted at a diameter of
approximately 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inches, allowing an ample margin for even the
largest racers, though inadequately small to permit ingress of a few
of the largest black rat snakes, bull snakes and timber rattlers occurring
locally.</p>

<p>Ordinarily the snakes trapped were processed in the field and released
immediately. The method of marking was essentially that of
Blanchard and Finster (1933:334). Two subcaudals, one on the
right side and one on the left, were clipped on each snake, and
when these marks healed they left permanent scars. In the racer,
as in most other colubrines, the subcaudals are divided into a double
series, one on the left and one on the right. Scales of the left and
right sides are placed alternately. At the base of the tail one or
more undersized scales usually are present on each side, and there
might be some question as to precisely where the count should begin.
The rule followed was to exclude from the count any small
basal scales on either side that did not extend medially to contact
at least one scale of the opposite side. The scale designated as "one
left" (or "one right") was the first to contact one of the opposite
series, regardless of whether the former was of normal size or (as
was usually the case) smaller and narrower than those following
it. In marking, this "number one" scale was never clipped but was
left as a point of reference since a base mark was needed from
which to begin the count. The marks were read from left to
right, for example U 5<i>l</i> 2<i>r</i>, the "U" referring to the subcaudals or
"urosteges," the "5<i>l</i>" indicating the fifth on the left side, and "2<i>r</i>"
indicating the second on the right. The subcaudals clipped were the
first 19 following the basal scale. When the 361 possible combinations
all had been used, ending with U 20<i>l</i> 20<i>r</i>, a new series was
begun duplicating the first except that on each snake the first
ventral (or "gastrostege") anterior to the anal plate was clipped on
the left side (G1L) to distinguish these snakes from the series
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
previously marked. Later, a third series, "G2R" was marked, and
eventually a fourth series, "G3L" was started.</p>

<p>There were many borderline instances in which the basal scale
barely contacted one of the opposite side. In such instances the
formula was written U 5<i>l</i> <sub>ISB</sub> 2<i>r</i>, the subscript ISB signifying "including
small basal." In other instances a basal subcaudal barely
failed to contact a scale of the opposite side and this condition was
indicated by the subscript NSB&mdash;"not including small basal." The
condition might be so nearly equivocal that on successive occasions
the same formula might be read U 5<i>l</i> <sub>ISB</sub> 2<i>r</i> and U 4<i>l</i> <sub>NSB</sub> 2<i>r</i>.
Occasional misidentifications of individuals that resulted from such
discrepancies were in most instances readily detected when the
field records were transferred to individual file cards where the
sex, size, and location of the snake at its previous captures were
shown.</p>

<p>In some instances racers recaptured after periods of years retained
conspicuous scars where scales had been clipped, but in other
instances the marks had become obscure, and in fact the only trace
of a mark might be a slight narrowing or notching of part of the
scale originally clipped. Snakes caught and marked early in life
probably retained more power of regeneration than those clipped
after the attainment of maturity, but otherwise the basis for difference
in extent of regeneration was not evident. In the same
snake, three scales, all clipped on the same day, might show much
different degrees of regeneration after the lapse of a year or more.
In general, obscuring of marks by regeneration was a source of inconvenience
rather than of error; only a negligible percentage of
the recaptured racers had marks so obscure that their identities
might have been seriously questioned, and it is doubtful that any
marks were lost completely by regeneration.</p>

<p>Racers found in traps were removed, measured (snout-to-vent
length, tail length), weighed in a cloth bag suspended from spring
scales, and marked. The mouth was forced open and the snake
was examined for flukes. Enamel paint of a bright color, red, green,
yellow, blue or orange was smeared on the snake to gain information
regarding the time of molt. The stomach was palpated for
recently ingested food items, and any detected were forced up into
the gullet to be identified, then were squeezed back into the
stomach. The rear part of the body was palpated to detect undigested
material in the gut, and if any was present, an attempt
was made to squeeze out the fecal material, using only light pressure,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
with care not to injure the racer. The inside of the trap and
the ground beneath it were inspected for fecal material that might
have been voided while the snake was confined. Any scatological
material obtained was wrapped in a paper towel, labelled and
brought back to the laboratory where it was stored. Eventually
each scat was soaked for a day or more in a detergent solution,
rinsed in running water in a fine gauze bag, dried, and placed with
its label in a cellophane envelope for subsequent microscopical
study.</p>

<p>Various items concerning reproductive condition were also
routinely recorded. In females the ventral surface was palpated at
the rear end of the body to detect the genital bursa or vagina,
which in sexually mature individuals has a much thickened wall,
and can be felt as a distinct lump. Males were likewise tested
for sexual maturity by pipetting a small amount of fluid from the
cloaca into a vial and returning it to the laboratory where it was
examined microscopically for motile sperm. Also, sperm samples
were often taken from males at different times throughout the
season of activity, and cloacal samples from females occasionally
were checked for sperm as evidence of recent copulation.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1962 an outdoor enclosure of 100-foot circumference
was constructed, of galvanized sheet iron, with wall
three feet high, set on a concrete base extending to a depth of two
feet. A two-foot-deep concrete basin inside the enclosure served
as a water container. The enclosure was partly shaded by a large
walnut tree and the area enclosed had lush vegetation, including
brome grass, various shrubs, and young trees up to 15 feet high,
thus including most features of the racers' habitat, and it was
situated in an area frequented by the snakes. Throughout the
summer several racers were kept in the enclosure, and frequent
observations on them yielded much information concerning time of
activity, temperature preferences, and social and sexual behavior
that could not have been obtained readily either from racers confined
in small cages or from those free under natural conditions.</p>




<p class="caption2"><a name="Description" id="Description"></a>Description</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="Color_Pattern" id="Color_Pattern"></a><i>Color Pattern</i></p>

<p>Hatchling racers differ much in appearance from adults; whereas
the latter are of dull uniform coloration dorsally, the hatchlings
have a checkered pattern of alternating blotches in several rows, including
a middorsal row, with blotches much larger than those of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
the other rows. This basic pattern is perhaps the most common
one in all snakes, and is found in the young of various other genera
(notably <i>Elaphe</i>) which lose or alter their markings during development.
In these genera and in the racer, the juvenal checkered
pattern may represent recapitulation of an ancestral condition.
The adaptive significance of having a blotched, checkered pattern
in the young, and uniform coloration in the adult is not evident.
I have rarely seen the hatchlings under natural conditions except
by finding them hiding beneath flat rocks. Their concealing pattern
must be fully as effective as that of adults and the young themselves
are more secretive than the adults.</p>

<p>A hatchling of 240 millimeters snout-vent length was described
as follows on September 22, 1962: Ground color pale olive
anteriorly, gradually darkening posteriorly, marked with chocolate
blotches; middorsal blotches largest averaging about five scales
long and seven or eight scales wide anteriorly; posteriorly, blotches
become less distinct (tending to blend into progressively darkening
ground color), and width-to-length ratio increases; gradual obscuring
of blotches proceeds posteriorly, until on tail they can no
longer be distinguished, and color is uniformly olive; on each side,
row of lateral blotches alternates with that of middorsal blotches;
lateral blotches average somewhat less than two scales long, and approximately
two scales wide and are of irregular shape, sometimes
subdivided; farther down on sides, lower row of lateral blotches
alternates with upper lateral row; this lower lateral row, approximately
same size as upper lateral row, and situated at level of first
scale row, overlapping onto ventrals, where it pales to reddish
brown; almost every ventral scute has one pair or more of dark
reddish brown spots, tending toward semicircular shape, the arc
of each projecting forward, but posteriorly on body these spots become
increasingly obscure, and are indiscernible on posterior end
of body and on tail; ventral surface white on chin and throat,
gradually assuming suffusion of pale greenish gray posteriorly; eye
dark with narrow yellowish margin around pupil; top of head grayish
olive, mottled with faint and irregular dark markings; supralabials
whitish, with chocolate markings, mostly wedge-shaped, in
their posterior parts; rostral and internasals edged with dark
posteriorly; posterior upper corner of loreal and adjacent corner
of prefrontal dark; temporals having dark markings; chin almost
immaculate, but with narrow black posterior edges on some of the
infralabials (see <a href="#Plate_19">Plate 19, Figs. 1 and 2</a>, and <a href="#Plate_20_Fig_2">Plate 20, Fig. 2</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>The checkered pattern of the juvenile fades gradually as development
proceeds. Persistence of the juvenal markings varies greatly
in individuals and probably is subject to geographic variation also.
By the time sexual maturity is attained the dorsal pattern often is
indiscernible or represented only by faint traces. The ventral
speckling is more persistent.</p>

<p>A female of 602 millimeters snout-vent length in mid-July 1962,
at a probable age of 11 months, was described as follows: Overall
dorsal color olive gray, but with remnants of juvenal pattern discernible;
dark dorsal blotches have almost faded, but their edges,
about one scale wide, are still distinct; low on sides, color fades to
pale bluish gray, and to pale greenish blue on edges of ventrals; on
anterior one-third of body midventral surface is lemon yellow;
farther posteriorly it fades to ivory, almost white on tail; chin white,
except for reddish brown posterior edges of last infralabials, and
streak of same color on each antepenultimate infralabial; top of head
olive gray with irregular scattered dark marks; preoculars pale
centrally with olive brown edges; supralabials white with reddish
brown triangular marks; postnasals white anteriorly, gray posteriorly;
uppermost postocular brownish orange, paler centrally;
two rows of semicircular spots on belly, distinct anteriorly, but
fading posteriorly until indiscernible on posterior part of belly;
numerous small black spots scattered irregularly over dorsal and
lateral surfaces.</p>

<p>A male racer retained more of the juvenal pattern at an approximate
age of 15 months, when he was described on November 30,
1961: Dorsal surface dark grayish brown, the large juvenal dorsal
blotches (each about eight scales wide) easily discernible, but
faint; top of head dark olive brown, mottled with black, paling in
rostral region; supralabials white on their anterior and lower
portions, marked with brown and blue-gray on their upper and
posterior portions; chin white, but with rusty markings on last four
infralabials; ventrals ivory-yellow with rusty spots of which the
largest are approximately three-fourths of the ventrals' breadth;
first row of scales bluish gray, or with greenish suffusion (in neck),
most of scales having indistinct dark spots; second row of scales
similarly colored but more suffused with dusky pigment, blending
into the darker duller color of the dorsal surface.</p>

<p>A female of 720 millimeters snout-vent length, presumably about
20 months old, but not gravid, on June 13, 1962, was described as
follows: Juvenal pattern no longer clearly discernible but scattered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
traces of it remain; dorsal color predominantly grayish olive, with
occasional small black spots in streaks scattered irregularly over
dorsal and lateral surfaces; at anterior end of body lateral scales
have bluish green edges but this shading becomes less noticeable
posteriorly; head mostly olive dorsally with marking obscure;
parietals have a large faint blotch; supralabials retain faint dark,
brownish markings on their upper parts; dark spot on median edge
of each prefrontal; supraoculars slightly darker than adjacent scutes;
chin mostly white, with yellowish suffusion at edges of scales;
ventral surface predominantly yellow, but fading to grayish white
posteriorly; remnants of juvenal ventral spots faintly discernible as
tan or whitish areas on yellow ventrals.</p>

<p>Munro (1950b:124) mentioned a blue racer of 749 millimeters
total length (hence probably having a snout-vent length of 600
millimeters, or a little less), which retained faint juvenal markings
when caught on June 23, 1948, even though it was sexually mature,
since it laid eggs on the night of July 4, 1948. During several weeks
of captivity this snake's markings faded perceptibly.</p>

<p>In fully adult blue racers, those more than three years old, the
juvenal markings have become completely obliterated. In those
from the area of my study, the dorsal coloration is subject to much
individual variation, typically olive brown, but ranging from pale
bluish gray to dark brown, dark blue, or slaty. In most, the dorsal
color is uniform, but in some there are streaks and isolated scales of
black. The dark dorsal color extends down the sides onto the lateral
corners of the ventrals and the subcaudals. The chin is white but
the remainder of the ventral surface is ivory colored.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="Bodily_Proportions" id="Bodily_Proportions"></a><i>Bodily Proportions</i></p>

<p>The slender and streamlined bodily proportions of the racer are
subject to change through allometric growth. The head, and especially
the eyes, are relatively large in the hatchling, and become
relatively smaller as growth proceeds. The relative tail length
seemingly increases in the growing young and then decreases
slightly in adults.</p>

<p>Snout-vent length and tail length were recorded in almost all the
racers examined, but other measurements were recorded in relatively
few. In many racers, especially the larger adults, tails had been
damaged and lacked their terminal parts. Often only the tip was
missing, but, of course, such individuals were not usable in the
study of proportions of the tail. <a href="#Table_2">Table 2</a> summarizes information
concerning relative tail length in 935 racers of both sexes and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
various sizes, from northeastern Kansas. Nearly all measurements
are from the live snakes; a few are from recently killed individuals.</p>

<p>In hatchlings, the proportions of the tail are not noticeably different
in males and females, but data indicate that the snakes' tails
are approximately seven per cent longer in males than in females;
as growth proceeds, the tails become relatively longer in proportion
to the body, in both sexes. The ratio reaches its maximum in young
adults, having increased from approximately 28 per cent of the
snout-vent length in males and 26 per cent in females, to 31 per
cent in males and a little more than 28 per cent in females. In the
largest racers, of both sexes, these percentages are slightly reduced.
Tail-length is subject to a fairly wide range of individual variation,
which tends to obscure the trends determined by sex and size.</p>

<p>In 88 racers caught in the summer of 1962 the following measurements
were recorded: Head length, from tip of snout to angle of
jaw; maximum head width; greatest diameter of eye; circumference
of neck; circumference at mid-body; circumference at posterior end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
of body; and circumference of tail-base. Because the measurements
were small, and were made in the field on active, struggling snakes,
a high degree of precision could not be attained, and the range of
error was several per cent, with occasional relatively large errors.
Nevertheless, ontogenetic trends are clearly indicated. Most of
the racers measured were adults of small to medium size&mdash;in the
range 500 to 799 millimeters, snout-vent length. Twelve females
and seven males ranged from 800 to 1035 millimeters, and seven
young (all females) were less than 500 millimeters. In measurements
other than circumference of tail-base, significant differences
could not be found between males and females of the same size
group; therefore the sexes were combined to obtain larger series.</p>

<p>In the racer the maxillary, palatine, pterygoid, and dentary bones
bear teeth (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>). The teeth are all much alike in size and shape,
small, sharp, and recurved, typically at an angle of approximately
50 degrees. The number of teeth present is variable. Because the
teeth are small and loosely attached to the jaw bones, and often are
broken off in the capture and ingestion of prey, each bone usually
lacks part of its complement of teeth. Even the sockets vary somewhat
in number between individuals, and between the left and
right sides in some snakes. Most of the skulls that I examined were
not thoroughly cleaned, and the adherent dried tissues made it difficult
to obtain accurate counts of the sockets. In ten skulls from
Kansas and Nebraska, most frequently occurring numbers of sockets
for each of the dentigerous bones were: maxillary, 15; palatine, 11;
pterygoid, 18; dentary, 18.</p>

<p>Penial characters have proven to be useful in the classification of
snakes, providing bases for separating subfamilies, genera, and
species. In the racer even the subspecies have trenchant penial
characters by which they may be separated in some instances. The
hemipenis is roughly cylindrical, but widest at the base (<a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>).
The sulcus spermaticus is unbranched. Approximately the basal
one-third of the hemipenis has a smooth surface, broken only by the
sulcus spermaticus and by three greatly enlarged spines, which form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
hooks&mdash;one anterior, one posterior, and one dorsal. The dorsal hook
is the largest of the three. Distal to the smooth part is a zone of
small spines, each recurved and mounted on a fleshy tubercle. The
zone of spines is poorly developed
on the anterior side
and is interrupted on the
posterior side in the vicinity
of the sulcus spermaticus but
is best developed on the posterior
side a short distance
above and below the sulcus
spermaticus. The spines are
arranged in several oblique
rows. Those of the proximal
row are best developed, and
there is rapid diminution in
the size of those situated
farther distally. Approximately
the distal two fifths
of the hemipenis forms a third zone, lacking distinct spines, but
having numerous deep longitudinal grooves, alternating with lamellae
which have fimbriated edges, and which fuse with each other
and divide to form a reticulated pattern.</p>




<p class="caption2"><a name="Relationships" id="Relationships"></a>Relationships</p>


<p>The large genus <i>Coluber</i> is much in need of revision. Its many
species, perhaps more than a score in all, occur in North America
from southern Canada south to Guatemala, in eastern and southwestern
Asia, in southern Europe, and in North Africa. All are
active, slender-bodied snakes having smooth scales in few rows,
and having large eyes with well developed vision. The North
American species fall into two natural groups, the typical racers,
and the whip snakes, often assigned to a separate genus, <i>Masticophis</i>
(Ortenburger, 1928). The whip snakes are more specialized than
the typical racers in having the eyes more enlarged, and the body
form more slender and attenuate, with number of scale rows more
reduced. The racers of the Old World are more diverse. Inger
and Clark (1943) suggested a partitioning of the genus <i>Coluber</i> on
the basis of the pattern by which scale rows are reduced, from the
maximum number on the forebody to the minimum number at the
posterior end of the body, supplemented by certain characters of
the hemipenis and of the cephalic scutellation. Besides <i>Coluber</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
and <i>Masticophis</i> these authors recognized within the group the
genus <i>Platyceps</i> with several species in southern Europe and southwestern
Asia; <i>Zamenis</i> with several species in the same region and in
North Africa, and <i>Haemorrhois</i>, a monotypic genus of Spain, North
Africa and several Mediterranean islands. Although apparently
valid in principle, this arrangement has not been generally followed.</p>

<p>Exclusive of those species groups whose assignment to the genus
<i>Coluber</i> are somewhat questionable, the remaining species in the
genus are: <i>C. constrictor</i> occurring throughout most of the United
States and south along a narrow Atlantic coastal strip of Mexico to
Guatemala; <i>C. oaxacae</i> of southern Mexico; and <i>C. spinalis</i> of northern
China. <i>C. oaxacae</i> is poorly known as only a few specimens
have been collected, but seemingly it is a near relative and derivative
of <i>C. constrictor</i>, especially of that species' southernmost population.
<i>C. spinalis</i> is much more distinct, as might be expected from
its geographical remoteness. It is a slender, active snake, of olive
coloration dorsally with 17 scale rows and a bright yellow, black-edged
dorsal stripe and yellow ventral surface. It is relatively small
(up to 755 millimeters snout-vent length) and is partial to riparian
habitats but is also found in forests and in dry and barren regions
(Pope, 1935:224-226). It is known to feed upon lizards.</p>




<p class="caption2"><a name="Range" id="Range"></a>Range</p>


<p>The common racer has been recorded in each of the 48 states of
the mainland of the United States, also in New Brunswick, Nova
Scotia, southern British Columbia, and southward through Mexico
where it is limited to a narrow strip of east coast lowlands but extends
as far as Guatemala. <i>C. c. constrictor</i> occupies the northeastern
states and extends south into the Appalachian and Piedmont.
<i>C. c. priapus</i> with its associated races <i>paludicola</i>, <i>helvigularis</i>, and
<i>anthicus</i> has an Austroriparian distribution, occupying the Atlantic
Coastal plain and the Gulf Region, and extending north in the Mississippi
Valley to southern Illinois and Indiana. <i>C. c. paludicola</i> is
localized with two disjunct populations&mdash;in the Everglades and on
Cape Canaveral, Florida. <i>C. c. helvigularis</i> is even more restricted
in range and is known only from the Appalachicola region of the
Florida Panhandle and the adjacent corners of Alabama and
Georgia. <i>C. c. anthicus</i> occupies much of central and western
Louisiana and adjacent Texas. <i>C. c. flaviventris</i> occurs throughout
the Great Plains, east in the "Prairie Peninsula" through Michigan
and northern Ohio and west to the Rocky Mountains. <i>C. c.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
stejnegerianus</i> occurs from Matagorda Bay in Texas southward
through eastern Mexico, with a seemingly isolated population in
the Sierra del Carmen region of northern Coahulia. <i>C. c. mormon</i>
occurs in the Pacific Coast states and Great Basin.</p>

<p>Actually, the range limits and the continuity of distribution within
the area outlined are still poorly known. The species has not been
recorded from the northern parts of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire,
Michigan, Wisconsin, or Minnesota, nor from northeastern
New York. It is generally absent from southwestern desert areas.
Records are particularly scarce and scattered in the Rocky Mountain
states, suggesting that the distribution in this area may be discontinuous.
In a large area comprising all of New Mexico and Arizona,
the western half of Colorado, and the southern halves of Utah and
Nevada, records are so scarce as to indicate that the species is there
represented by only a few well isolated relict colonies. The type
locality of <i>mormon</i> is "Valley of the Great Salt Lake," and there
are numerous records from the northern part of Utah east of Great
Salt Lake (Woodbury, 1931:75), but a record from Moab is the
only one known to me from the southern half of the state. The only
records from western Colorado are from three miles east of Fruita
and two miles west of Grand Junction, Mesa County (Maslin,
1959:56). Apparently the only valid record from Arizona is that
of Shannon (1950:59) from Eagar, Apache County, in the east-central
part. Shannon also recorded the racer from Boulder Dam
in extreme southern Nevada. Brattstrom (1955:152) has recorded
the species from the lower Pleistocene of southeastern Arizona
(Curtis Ranch), bearing out the idea that the racer has partly
withdrawn from a range formerly occupied in the Southwest at a
time when cooler and moister climate prevailed. Other fossil occurrences
are of late Pleistocene age&mdash;Vero Beach and Seminole,
Florida (Brattstrom, 1953a:245) and, doubtfully, Rancho LaBrea,
California (Brattstrom, 1953b:376). The range of <i>mormon</i> has
been mapped (Wright and Wright, 1949:134) as extending east to
south-central Montana on the basis of one specimen allocated on the
basis of two characters. Otherwise the range of <i>mormon</i> seems to
be entirely west of the Continental Divide, well separated from
that of <i>flaviventris</i> by desert and mountain barriers. The conspecificity
of <i>mormon</i> with the other subspecies needs to be more
thoroughly investigated, and geographic variation within <i>mormon</i>
also merits study.</p><hr class="chap" />

<p class="caption2"><a name="Geographic_Variation" id="Geographic_Variation"></a>Geographic Variation</p>


<p>The common racer and the several species of whip snakes
(<i>Masticophis</i>) were revised by Ortenburger (1928). More recently
with much larger series of specimens, Auffenberg (1955) again revised
the classification of <i>C. constrictor</i>, but his study was concentrated
in Florida and neighboring southeastern states with relatively
little attention devoted to populations of the western and central
United States. As the species occurs throughout most of the United
States and south through the coastal lowlands of eastern Mexico to
Guatemala, it is found over a wide range of environmental conditions.
Various characters are subject to geographic variation, and
some of them follow clines that are maintained over extensive
areas. Such characters as the number of hemipenial spines, and
the enlargement of one or more basal spines into hooks, the shape
of the premaxillary bone, the number of maxillary teeth, the numbers
of ventrals and caudals, color of eye, number of dorsal saddle-marks
and of ventral spots in juveniles, and ratios of body proportions
including tail length to total length have been used to
characterize the subspecies.</p>

<p>Also important is the shade of coloration of adults. The subspecies
<i>constrictor</i>, <i>priapus</i> and <i>helvigularis</i> that are characteristic
of forested habitats in the eastern United States are black dorsally
and have their ventral surfaces suffused to a large extent with dark
or dusky coloring. Farther westward the ground color becomes
progressively paler, greenish, grayish or light brown, and the ventral
surface is yellow (white on the throat and neck). The same
tendency appears in <i>C. c. paludicola</i> of the Everglades. The populations
of arid climates in southern Texas and in the far western
states are relatively pale colored. The species thus conforms to
Gloger's Rule in changing from a pallid coloration in arid climates
to a dark pattern with eumelanins predominating in a humid
climate.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important character that is subject to geographic
variation in the racer, and certainly one of the most neglected,
is body size. With information now available it is not possible
to compare the sizes of different populations except in a
general way. The best sources of information concerning size in
several subspecies other than <i>flaviventris</i>, are the publications of
Auffenberg (1949 and 1955). Comparison of these data with my
own is not entirely satisfactory because Auffenberg did not indicate
clearly differences in size between the sexes, nor indicate the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
boundary line between young and adults. Also, his measurements
are of overall length. For the purpose of comparison I have subtracted
22.5 per cent, an approximation of ratio of average tail
length, from Auffenberg's figures. He stated (1955:98) that the
series of specimens on which measurements were based were those
"with a uniform coloration," that is to say they had lost the juvenal
pattern and were probably sexually mature. Whether the same
statement applied to the large series of <i>stejnegerianus</i> in the same
author's earlier paper (1949:55) is doubtful.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>C. c. constrictor</i>: 34 New York specimens averaged 806 millimeters (Auffenberg,
1955:96).</p>

<p><i>C. c. flaviventris</i>: 100 Kansas specimens averaged 791 millimeters (males,
746; females, 836).</p>

<p><i>C. c. priapus</i>: 171 Florida specimens averaged 713 millimeters (Auffenberg,
1955:96).</p>

<p><i>C. c. stejnegerianus</i>: 291 Texas specimens averaged 664 millimeters (Auffenberg,
1949:54).</p>

<p><i>C. c. mormon</i>: 94 West Coast specimens (Museum of Vertebrate Zoology)
averaged 563 millimeters (males 515, females 600).</p>

<p><i>C. c. anthicus</i>: 35 northern Louisiana specimens estimated to average 582
millimeters (Clark, 1949:249&mdash;the author did not present individual
measurements, but indicated the numbers in several size groups in his
sample).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 100 <i>flaviventris</i> in the above list were recorded in June, July
and August, a season when the young of the preceding year are
still small, and these young were not included. In a fall sample 63
males averaged 729 millimeters and 65 females averaged 886 millimeters,
but with the nearly grown young (44 males and 40 females)
included, the averages were changed to 651 and 768 respectively.
Maximum length perhaps express differences between the subspecies
as well as, or even better than, the averages listed above. The following
figures indicate some of the maximum overall length measurements
in inches that have been published by various authors.
These measurements pertain to females unless otherwise indicated.</p>

<p>In my own study, the largest racers recorded from the Reservation

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>These sets of figures show that compared with the blue racer in
Kansas, with which my own study was concerned, the black racer
of the northeastern states reaches a larger size, while the racers of
the Southeast and especially those of the far West and of southern
Texas, are dwarfed. These size differences are almost certainly
correlated with behavioral and ecological differences among the
snakes involved. Adaptations to exploit certain types of prey and
to utilize most efficiently certain habitats and types of cover, have
led to divergent trends in different parts of the range.</p>




<p class="caption2"><a name="Habitat" id="Habitat"></a>Habitat</p>


<p>The racer dwells primarily in open situations, but as might be
expected from its extensive geographic range, bringing it under the
influence of diverse climates and habitats, its populations have
diverged somewhat in adaptation to different environmental conditions.
The eastern blacksnakes (subspecies <i>constrictor</i> and
<i>priapus</i>) seem to prefer woodland and forest edge. In central
Louisiana, <i>anthicus</i> occurs chiefly in an open type of woodland.
The subspecies <i>stejnegerianus</i> is found chiefly in brushland and
thorn forest. The western <i>mormon</i> is found in varied habitats, including
moist streamside meadows, and chaparral. Published statements
of herpetologists, based upon studies in limited areas, are
briefly quoted below to show the trend of geographic change.</p>

<div class="sm_text">
<p><i>C. c. constrictor</i>: This snake "occurs chiefly in fields" (Atkinson, 1901:148;

regions" (Hibbard, 1936:28, in Kentucky); "dry and more or less open places"

Mississippi); "abundant along fence rows ... in dry pine-oak forest and
in bottomland forest" (Trowbridge, 1937:296, in Oklahoma); "probably most
abundant in open upland hammock or in old fields; limestone flatwoods" (Carr,
1950:80, in Florida); Oak and oak-hickory forest and small hill prairies in
southern Illinois (Rossman, 1960:219).</p>

<p>Every part of the 590-acre Reservation is used to some extent by
blue racers living on this area. Home ranges of most individuals
are so large as to include a variety of habitats, both woodland and
grassland. The habitat preferences vary according to season. In
autumn some racers migrating to rock ledges to hibernate are found
in mesic forest, but at that time of year leaves have begun to fall
and the forest floor is less dark and humid than in summer. In
spring also racers not yet back on their summer ranges are often
seen either along the hilltop ledges, or moving downhill through
woods toward bottomland meadows. However, in summer, the
finding of a racer in mesic woodland is a rare event. Occasionally
the snakes make trips across such blocks of woodland hundreds of
feet wide, but they do not linger in the woodland. In decreasing
order of preference the habitats used by racers on my study area
may be classified as follows:</p>

<div class="sm_text">
<p>1. Tall-grass prairie, (<a href="#Plate_22">Plate 22</a>) either original or regenerated, dominated
by native perennial grasses in stands three feet to seven feet high, including big
blue-stem (<i>Andropogon gerardi</i>), little blue-stem (<i>A. scoparius</i>) Indian grass
(<i>Sorghastrum nutans</i>), and switchgrass (<i>Panicum virgatum</i>).</p>

<p>2. Pastureland, with introduced brome grass (<i>Bromus inermis</i>) and associated
weedy vegetation.</p>

<p>3. Brush, in ravines, at woodland edge, and in riparian thickets.</p>

<p>4. Weedy fields, dominated by such pioneer plants as ragweeds, sunflowers,
horseweed, milkweed, wild lettuce, aster and goldenrod.</p>

<p>5. Open type of woodland dominated by such trees as honey locust and
osage orange.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>These habitat types are interspersed on the study area, and each
racer has a wide choice of habitats without travelling beyond the
limits of its own chosen area.</p>

<p>Grassland that has been closely grazed, mowed or burned does
not provide entirely adequate food or shelter, and under such conditions
clumps of brush or other dense vegetation may be of critical
importance. Throughout the racer's extensive range, fields of grain
and hay at times provide suitable habitat, and may support large
populations, but in spring, before the young cultivated plants have
made much growth, or later in the season, after they have been cut,
the racer may need to depend on adjacent areas of pasture, thicket,
or woodland edge and the availability of such refugia to a large extent
determines the numbers of racers on cultivated areas.</p>

<p>In the locality of my study racers spend approximately half the
year in winter dormancy. Earliest spring records and latest fall
records for 13 years are shown in <a href="#Table_4">Table 4</a>. The spring records in
nearly all instances pertain to snakes found in the open or beneath
flat rocks warmed by sunshine, usually at or near the rock ledges
where hibernation occurs. Juveniles are especially well represented
in these earliest spring records, and it seems that they tend to emerge
a little earlier, on the average, than the adults, either because they
have hibernated in more superficial and less well insulated situations
or because their lesser body mass permits more rapid warming to
activity than can occur in the adults. The latest fall records all
pertain to racers trapped along the rock outcrops, and none was a
young of the year.</p>

<p>Most of the population undoubtedly emerged somewhat later
than the average date of April 16 indicated by the records in <a href="#Table_4">Table 4</a>,
and retired somewhat earlier than the average date of November
8. However, a small percentage of the population probably
emerged even earlier each year than my records indicate, and retired
into hibernation later than my records indicate. In a typical
year, temperatures in April and early May are only occasionally
above the level at which racers are able to become active, but are
below this threshold most of the time. The same statement applies
to an autumn period of late October and November. Most
racers are dormant in their hibernacula during these transitional
periods of spring and autumn, but some&mdash;those that have emerged
early in spring, or those that have not yet retired (in fall)&mdash;retreat
to temporary shelters and revert to a semi-torpid state when temperatures
fall below the critical level.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a> shows the relative extent of activity along the hilltop outcrops,
as reflected by numbers of racers caught at different times
during the autumn. Data from 14 years are combined, and the
large composite sample indicates that in an average year there is
relatively little activity along the hilltop outcrops in early September,
but that activity rapidly increases to a peak in mid-October
and then tapers off rapidly, usually ending in mid-November, but
occasionally ending as early as late October or as late as late November.</p>

<p>The racers recorded in traps had, in many instances, been confined
in them for from one to three days before they were found.
For any one year records are not sufficiently numerous to show the
trend as well as <a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>, but <a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a> shows year-to-year differences;
1958 was a fairly typical year, and also was the year in which the
largest sample was obtained; in 1949 the largest catches were made
earlier than usual, and the racers retired early into hibernation; in
1954 warm weather persisted until unusually late in autumn, and
racers remained active beyond the time when they ordinarily would
have been hibernating; in 1955 and 1961 the most concentrated
activity along the outcrops, as reflected by day to day catches,
came later than usual, but unseasonably cold weather ended all
activity abruptly, earlier than usual.</p>

<p>The racer's annual cycle of activity is, of course, controlled primarily
by the weather, and is much delayed or accelerated in some
years. But certain stabilizing factors cause the racer's annual cycle
to be less variable than that of the weather. For example, in spring
when persistently cool weather delays emergence from hibernation
beyond the normal time, the increasing azimuth of the sun, and
more intense sunshine cause the soil to warm, despite low air temperature,
until emergence is finally triggered. Having once emerged,
the racer is able to control its bodily temperature to a large extent
by basking in sunshine to gain warmth, or by seeking shade or
underground shelter to escape overheating. By such behavioral
thermoregulation extremes of weather are neutralized, or at least
buffered to some degree.</p>

</div>

<p>In the course of my study no racers were found in their actual
hibernacula. Insofar as known, these were always in deep crevices
in strata of limestone near hilltops, and were inaccessible except
by removal of the solid rock. The crevices where racers hibernate
are known to be several feet deep in some instances, extending well
below the frost line. Periodic temperature readings in two such
crevices at depths of 12 inches and 30 inches, taken in the winter
of 1954 (Fitch, 1956:471) showed that temperatures during dormancy
are usually well within the range 0°C to 10°. Whether the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
racers congregate in hibernating masses in regular "dens" on the
Reservation has not been definitely determined, but if so, most of
the hibernating groups must be small, because those trapped along
the ledges are well scattered, and, in fact, give the impression of
being rather uniformly distributed along them. However, ledges
of northward exposure are not used as hibernation sites, so far as
known, and those of full southward exposure are perhaps preferred,
especially where the hilltop has a southward projecting spur,
and the exposed rock face is extensive, with many cracks and
fissures. I have been unable to detect differences in types of
hibernation sites preferred between the racer and the copperhead,
which is somewhat more numerous on the same area.</p>

<p>Several authors have contributed to knowledge of hibernation in
the racer. Boyer and Heinze in Missouri (1934:195) noted that
blue racers often were associated with copperheads in the vicinity
of places chosen for hibernation. Burt (1935:329) in Kansas found
blue racers emerging from dens among rocks on a prairie hillside,
associating with other snakes, <i>Diadophis punctatus</i>, <i>Elaphe guttata</i>,
and <i>Pituophis melanoleucus</i>. In the Chicago region, Pope (1944:173)
reported scores of blue racers aggregating in October on and
around a sand dune with oak woodland. In Ohio, Conant (1938:55)
found three blue racers hibernating together about three feet
underground in a small hole. One found at another locality had
apparently hibernated in company with a massasauga (<i>Sistrurus
catenatus</i>). In Maryland Cohen (1939:137) saw racers (<i>C. c.
constrictor</i>) in the act of emerging from an old vole burrow that
was a communal hibernaculum, on April 6, 8, and 10. Air temperatures
at the time of emergence were 12.5° and 18.5° Centigrade.
In Illinois, Schroder (1950:1-2) found seven blue racers hibernating
in masses, intertwined with each other and with bull snakes at
depths of 36 inches and 42 inches in an abandoned mammal burrow
in a sand dune area in early February.</p>

</div>

<p>In the course of routine field work I often carried a Schultheis
quick-reading thermometer, and from time to time I had opportunities
to take the body temperatures of blue racers newly captured
by hand. The trend of these records indicated the temperature
range within which the snakes normally limit their activity, and
the preferred temperature. In an earlier publication (Fitch, 1956:459-460)
based on a few more than half the number of records of
temperature now available, I discussed responses of the blue racer
to temperature. The newer data bear out the trends previously
revealed; of 60 records, 39 are within the six-degree range from
29° to 35°, and records are most concentrated in the one-degree
range, 34° to 35°. Racers were found active at air temperatures
between 15.5° and 32.4°, with the greatest concentration between
26° and 27°. Compared with most other kinds of North American
snakes, the racer is remarkably tolerant of heat, and often is several
degrees warmer than the level that those of other genera will
normally tolerate. Racers have been seen crawling in the sunshine,
or basking on days that were uncomfortably hot for humans.
For example, on August 28, a large female racer released from a
trap was followed and her behavior observed; after crawling some
50 feet through the grass she climbed from a ditch bank onto sunflower
stalks and elm saplings, and came to rest among the stalks,
in a spot strategically situated for catching grasshoppers. More
than half her body was exposed to sunshine and air temperature was
slightly above 34° Centigrade, yet the snake showed no sign of discomfort,
and for the several minutes that she was kept under observation,
did not attempt to withdraw into the shade.</p>

Park. Opportunity to regulate temperature by behavior was limited in these
snakes in traps, which tended to match ambient temperatures.</p>
</div>

<p>At the Harvey County study area, bodily temperatures were recorded
in many of the racers that were caught in traps. These
records are much less significant than the records obtained from
racers caught by hand and promptly checked for bodily temperatures.
The temperatures of the trapped snakes may, to a large
extent, reflect the temperatures of air and soil at the time. However,
despite their confinement, the trapped racers probably were
able to exercise some control over their temperatures by shifting
from shade to sunshine, or from the top of the trap to its bottom,
where they would be in contact with the substrate. In most of the
racers removed from traps, as in those caught by hand, bodily
temperatures were somewhat above air temperatures, but the difference
was less in the former group of snakes. <a href="#Fig_8">Figure 8</a> shows the
bodily temperatures of these snakes removed from traps. Occasionally
racers died in the traps from overheating. On July 2,
1960, each of two racers in traps had temperatures of 39.4°. One
of these was especially vicious and frantic in its attempts to escape,
but otherwise seemed unharmed. The second racer was dead,
seemingly having succumbed just before it was found. Probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
prolonged exposure to temperature in excess of 39° would always
result in death of the snake. Racers and other snakes that had
become overheated in the traps and were nearing exhaustion had
a characteristic limp feel when they were handled. In June, 1960,
heat tolerance of a halfgrown racer was compared with that of
several other snakes including a copperhead, garter snakes, and
ringneck snakes. Each snake in turn was enclosed in a plastic tube
plugged with cotton at one end, the snake having a quick-reading
thermometer taped in place for a rectal reading. The tube was
then placed in sunshine. Over periods of minutes the enclosed
snake passed through a characteristic cycle. Soon it would begin
to register discomfort as its temperature rose rapidly. Its struggles
would become increasingly violent, then would cease abruptly.
The snake would suddenly collapse, its body mostly limp, but
knotted in slow contortions, its mouth gaping widely. Within a
few seconds all movements would cease, but in each instance the
seemingly dead snake was soon revived by holding it in cold running
water. The copperhead, garter snakes, and ring-necked snakes
all collapsed at temperatures near 41°. At this same temperature
the racer showed signs of acute discomfort, but did not collapse
even after many minutes of exposure. Probably more protracted
exposure at this level would have been fatal to the racer as well as
to the other kinds tested.</p>




<p class="caption2"><a name="Home_Range_and_Movements" id="Home_Range_and_Movements"></a>Home Range and Movements</p>


<p>Blue racers that were recorded on more than one occasion were
rarely caught again at the original location. For different individuals,
distances between capture points ranged from zero up to
a little more than three-fourths of a mile. The area of concentrated
study was a mile and a half in greatest diameter; there was scant
opportunity for capturing racers that moved greater distances. Even
those that moved as far as a mile would have passed beyond the
boundaries of the study area in most instances. Many of the
marked racers that disappeared from my records probably moved
beyond the limits of the study area. Nevertheless, in the great
majority of instances, the distances between successive capture
points for the same individual were relatively short, indicating that
each racer tends to remain permanently in a restricted area.</p>

<p>Most captures were made in the type of grassland or brush that
provides favorable habitat for the racer during the season of activity,
but many other captures were made in woodland along the rock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
ledges where the snakes come to hibernate. Four different types
of movement may be recognized: 1) those in the rock ledge area
where hibernation occurs; 2) those between the area where the
summer is spent and the hibernation ledge&mdash;an actual small scale
seasonal migration which takes place in spring and autumn&mdash;3)
those within a home range, which are part of the day-to-day activities
of the racer, and, 4) wandering movements by which the racer
shifts its activities, perhaps permanently, from one area to another.
In the records of any one snake these different types of movements
cannot always be sorted with certainty. Each type will be discussed
separately.</p>

<p>Relatively few movements along the ledges were recorded. It
seems that having migrated to a ledge, the racer promptly finds its
hibernaculum and retires for the winter. In spring there is equally
prompt scattering of the emerging racers, which no longer find the
ledge attractive. Most recorded movements along the ledges were
short. Of 76 movements, nine exceeded 1000 feet, and only four
others exceeded 500 feet. Most of the shorter movements were recorded
within an autumn season, but several were recorded after
the lapse of one or more seasons of activity. The longer movements
were as follows: 1250 feet after 8 seasons (male); 1300 feet
after three seasons (female); 1600 feet after one season (female);
2000 feet after one season (female); 2280 feet after seven seasons
(male); 2200 feet in same season (female); 2410, 2600, and 3200
feet, each after one season (all males). The trend of these records
suggests that the tendency to return year after year to the same
hibernaculum is not strong; after using one for a period of years,
the racer may abandon the stretch of ledge and, starting out in the
opposite direction from its summer range, find a new hibernaculum
as much as half a mile from the old one. Records of distances between
capture points on the ledges for individual racers are shown
in <a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a>.</p>

<p>A total of 124 movements between summer ranges and ledges
were recorded, and the distances averaged 1309 feet&mdash;approximately
a quarter mile. Some racers living in hilltop fields may
have had home ranges that included rock ledges, or at least were
adjacent to them. In such instances no seasonal migrations would
have been necessary to reach hibernacula in the autumn and summer
ranges in the spring. Several short movements&mdash;100 feet, 150
feet, and 200 feet&mdash;can be explained on the basis that home ranges
and hibernation ledges overlapped or were near at hand, but most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
of the movements were longer. The longest movement was 4020
feet, after a lapse of four seasons. Twenty-four movements exceeding
2000 feet were recorded. For these the intervals between
captures averaged more than double the time for the remaining
movements, indicating that the longtime permanent shifts were involved
in many instances.</p>

used for hibernation, and summer habitat on the Reservation and Rockefeller
Tract. Movements of females tend to be somewhat shorter than those of males.</p>
</div>

<p>For all the racers living in bottomland, ranges were separated
from ledges by areas of wooded hillsides averaging approximately
700 feet across. These relatively unfavorable areas had to be
traversed in the course of the semi-annual migrations. Even some
of the racers that lived in hilltop fields apparently crossed wooded
slopes in order to reach distant hibernation ledges, or else each
reached the ledge by a roundabout route although it could have
found a ledge much nearer its summer range. For the 124 ledge-to-field
and field-to-ledge movements, the median distance was
1030 feet. The sexes were almost equally represented in this sample
but the average distance for the 55 males&mdash;1425 feet&mdash;notably exceeded
that for the 69 females&mdash;1220 feet. These movements are
shown in <a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>.</p>

<p>McCauley (1945:76) in Maryland described what seemed to be
incipient territoriality in a large male racer that remained several
hours in a small area, crawling about conspicuously with head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
raised, seemingly on patrol. When an even larger male racer intruded,
the first one aggressively drove him away, but neither paid
any attention to a king snake that was also on the area. Other
authors have noted the attachment of a racer to a small familiar
area. Conant (1938:53) wrote that many of the racers he saw
sought shelter in definite retreats. One of these racers was seen
resting on top of a brush pile four times in a single afternoon, and
each time it followed the same route to the same inaccessible spot
beneath the brush.</p>

<p>My own observations do not bear out the idea that racers maintain
regular territories, since several males may be present within
a small area, even in the breeding season. Hostile behavior between
males has not been observed by me under natural conditions,
and in confinement has been seen only in instances of self defense.
Like the racer Conant observed on a brush pile, individuals may
linger in the vicinity of a favored shelter or foraging area for periods
of hours, but such associations are ephemeral, and soon the snake
moves on. In a uniformly favorable habitat a racer may cruise
about freely in tall grass or brush. Individuals that I have attempted
to follow, after flushing them or releasing them from traps,
often covered distances of 100 to 300 feet within periods of a few
minutes before I lost them. In such instances I maintained sufficient
distance between myself and the snake so that the latter was
not actively escaping. Probably the snake was not aware of pursuit
in most instances, although I was able to glimpse it through
the stems of grass, weeds, or shrubs, or was informed of its course
by the swaying tops of grass and other vegetation.</p>

<p>For many of the racers captured over periods of years it was
possible to plot "minimum home ranges" in the areas that they occupied.
One caught 12 times in five consecutive years will serve
as a typical example. There were seven locations involved; three
captures were made at one point and two captures at each of two
others; the other five locations were each represented by a single
capture. One of the seven locations was for a capture made at a
rock ledge in October, and hence can be eliminated from considerations
of home range. The other six locations are based upon
captures made from late May to early August, and they form a
rhomboid pattern, with three locations in alignment on one side
and two others inside the quadrangular figure formed by the five
outlying points. Obviously such a group of records gives some
idea of the location and extent of the snake's activities but the information
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
is far from complete. As shown by Odum and Kuenzler
(1955), a much larger series of records, usually several dozen, with
eight or more marginal locations, is necessary to illustrate even an
approximation of the actual home range. Under the conditions of
my study such a series of records was unattainable. Few if any of
the racers recaptured had more complete series of records than the
one mentioned above.</p>

<p>For 20 racers the records were sufficiently numerous and well
distributed to permit plotting of minimum home ranges. One of
these ranges was hexagonal, nine were pentagonal, eight were
rhomboidal and three were triangles. In four instances the area
encompassed was broken by woodland, indicating that the home
range comprised two or three disjunct segments. In all instances
the smaller segments were triangular. The 20 minimum home
ranges averaged 6.6 acres (3.2 to 12.8). The 15 ranges of males
averaged 7.3 acres, whereas the five ranges of females averaged
only 4.5 acres, but the sample is too small to be relied upon for
differences in the sexes.</p>

<p class="fig_caption"><a name="Fig_10" id="Fig_10"></a><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span> Movements of blue racers within or between areas of summer habitat
on the Reservation and Rockefeller Tract. The trends are much alike for
males and females.</p>
</div>

<p>In an earlier publication (Fitch, 1958:73) I discussed an alternative
method for determining size of home range in animals that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
move about freely within a chosen area, not having their movements
restricted by attachment to a specific home base. Ordinarily
any two records of the animal within its home range will be
separated <i>on the average</i> by a distance equal to half the diameter
of the area. Assuming that home ranges in general tend to have a
circular shape, except as restricted by limiting environmental factors,
the area can be easily computed from the average recorded
movement&mdash;the home range radius. It is necessary, of course, to
have a sufficiently large number of records of movements to obtain
an average that is statistically reliable.</p>

<p>A major problem is that of recognizing movements that involve
an extension of the original range or a shift away from it to a new
area. A few exceptionally long movements were recorded. If
these are included in the computations of home range, they greatly
increase the average distance, probably introducing error. Also,
the number of exceptionally short movements was greater than
might have been expected if all locations of capture are at random
to each other. In some instances a racer newly released may have
blundered into the same trap again, or into the trap at the opposite
end of its drift fence. In other instances traps may have been so
strategically situated with respect to preferred travel routes that
they caught the same snakes repeatedly. In still other instances,
the range of an individual might have been mostly outside the study
area, with only one end or corner overlapping the trap sites.</p>

<p>A total of 471 records for consecutive captures in field areas is
available, 305 for males and 166 for females. In 20 instances successive
sites of capture were the same and movement was recorded
as zero. Of the 471 records, 207 involved a relatively long time
span, including at least one hibernation period; the remaining 264
were based upon successive records within the same season of
activity. The trends were much the same in the records involving
a longer time span (up to four years) as in those records involving
captures made in a single season, but for the longer periods there
were some exceptionally long movements, and relatively few short
movements of less than 100 feet.</p>

<p>Records of male racers and those of females were used for
separate computations. For each series, the ten per cent of movements
that were longest and the ten per cent that were shortest
were eliminated from consideration in calculation of the average
distance between points of capture. For the remaining 244 records
of males an average movement of 595 feet was calculated, and for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
132 records of females an average movement of 574 feet. These
distances, if accepted as typical home range radii, would represent
home ranges of 26.3 acres for males and 23.8 for females. In an
earlier discussion of spatial relationships in the racer (Fitch, 1958:119),
based upon relatively scanty data, I estimated the home range
to be approximately 23 acres in males. But with only nine records
for female racers I calculated the home range to be 9.7 acres.</p>

<p>The disparate figures obtained from plotting minimum home
range and from calculating average home range radius are not irreconcilable,
since a minimum home range based on only four or
five points would ordinarily include only a fraction of the actual
range. Distances up to 1500 feet are included in the calculation
of home range. It seems that home ranges often have a diameter
of this magnitude or a little larger, although the estimated average
diameter is 1140 feet. Home ranges probably most often deviate
from circular shape to form an ellipse, with one diameter markedly
exceeding the other. Woodland, water, roads, buildings, or cultivated
fields, or other areas that are unfavorable or uninhabitable
often form the boundary of a home range and influence its shape.</p>

<p>Many of the longer movements constituted clear-cut shifts in
range. In one exceptional instance a large adult female captured
in the northeastern part of the Reservation on June 22, 1950, was
released 21 days later at a point 3900 feet southwest of the place
of capture. On May 27, 1960 she was caught within 600 feet of the
original location, seemingly having made a homing movement.
Among the nine racers recorded to have made longest movements
(exclusive of those movements made to or from hibernacula) four
were recorded also to have made later long movements in the reverse
direction, probably returning, each to its original home range,
although in every instance the return movement was somewhat less
than the original. A female of two-year-old size when first captured
on September 2, 1957, was recaptured 3100 feet southeast on
May 10, 1958. On August 7, 1959, she was recaptured again 2400
feet from the second location in the direction of the original capture.
Similarly, in a three-year-old female a shift of 2730 feet was recorded
at the second capture after 21 months, and at the third
capture 14 months after the second, a return trip of 2360 feet had
been made. A second-year female made a trip of 2640 feet between
May 17 and October 1, 1960; by May 1961 she had returned 2000
feet to the vicinity of her original capture. From one year to the
next an adult male shifted 2450 feet; after another year he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
moved back 1550 feet. Most of the longer movements recorded
were those between home ranges in fields and hibernacula along
ledges, but in this class of movements, distance was somewhat
proportional to elapsed time. For 59 such movements exceeding
2000 feet the average was 3.1 years, whereas for 114 field-to-ledge
movements of less than 2000 feet, average elapsed time was 1.6
years. This trend suggests that over periods of years a racer is
likely to shift its range or its hibernaculum or both.</p>

blue racers recorded to have shifted over the longest distances. The figure
following the sex sign of each individual indicates number of months elapsed
between the captures at the localities represented by the dots.</p>
</div>

<p>Average elapsed time between captures was 7.7 months. In the
471 field-to-field movements recorded, 53&mdash;slightly more than eleven
per cent&mdash;exceeded 1500 feet and can reasonably be considered
shifts of home range. The average elapsed time between captures
for this group of snakes was 9.5 months. The evidence suggests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
that, even in an area of favorable habitat, somewhat more than ten
per cent of the racers in a population annually shift their home
ranges somewhat, but that many stay in the same home range for
periods of years or perhaps throughout life.</p>

<p>Shifts in range were especially noticeable where availability of
suitable habitat underwent seasonal change. Along the north edge
of the Reservation, prairie adjoined cultivated fields where grain or
hay was grown. Until late May, the cultivated crops made little
growth and the fields were almost bare. They provided insufficient
shelter for the racers, which tended to keep to the prairie, where
old grass of the previous year's growth furnished them with ample
cover. Later in the season, crops, of oats, wheat, and alfalfa constituted
suitable cover for the racers, and many of them shifted
their ranges to the cultivated fields, but corn and milo crops were
much less adequate for their needs. After harvesting of crops,
cover in the fields was again inadequate for the racers' needs, and
they tended to retreat to edge situations, or to adjacent prairie.</p>

<p class="caption3"><a name="Methods_of_Obtaining_Prey" id="Methods_of_Obtaining_Prey"></a><i>Methods of Obtaining Prey</i></p>

<p>The racer hunts by stealth, but actively, obtaining its prey by
keen eyesight and swift movements. Wright and Bishop (1915:160)
wrote that because of its great speed it can catch anything that
moves on the ground. As a racer moves stealthily through dense
vegetation, its dull, uniform dorsal color blends well with the surface
litter of dead plant material. In prowling, the snake glides
along rapidly and alertly, in a jerky fashion, with frequent momentary
pauses and changes of direction. Because of its inconspicuousness,
it is not likely to be detected by the prey until it is close at
hand. The snake is ready to dash in pursuit of any small animal
that flies, jumps or runs to escape.</p>

<p>On August 27, 1955, my daughter observed a large racer hunting
among tall weeds at the edge of the pond on the Reservation.
Several times in the course of its movements, it flushed small frogs
(<i>Rana pipiens</i>) and each time the snake darted in unsuccessful
pursuit of the rapidly hopping frog. On several occasions I have
been led to a blue racer by the distressed croaking of a frog that
the snake had captured. In each instance, despite my cautious approach,
the racer saw me before I detected it, and then darted
away, abandoning its prey. On one occasion, while I was still a
few yards from the racer, and before the latter had detected me, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
frog broke free and hopped away rapidly through tall grass and
weeds, and after several leaps, hid, concealed by dense screening
vegetation. The racer darted in pursuit but could not find the frog.
For several minutes the snake persisted in an active search; with
forebody elevated and head held high, it would turn first in one
direction and then in another, with nervous, jerky movements,
obviously keyed up to a high pitch of excitement. Then it became
aware of my presence, lowered its head, and glided away rapidly,
abandoning the search.</p>

<p>Although the racer depends to a large extent on sight to find its
prey, scent may play some part also, as indicated by the presence
in the food of young mammals taken from nests, some probably
found underground. Near Garnett, Kansas, on May 4, 1952,
Richard B. Loomis found a racer attacking a collared lizard
(<i>Crotaphytus collaris</i>) beneath a large flat rock. The lizard was
retaliating by biting the snake's neck. The posterior part of the
snake protruded into the open, and its thrashing had directed the
attention of the observer to it. Whether the racer first found the
lizard under the rock, or followed it there after flushing it in the
open is unknown.</p>

<p>An encounter between a large blue racer and an adult Great
Plains skink (<i>Eumeces obsoletus</i>) on August 30, 1948, was described
as follows: "The skink, grasped by one flank, had twisted
back and seized the skin of the snake's neck in a bulldog grip, and
they lay interlocked, motionless except for their rapid panting, and
occasional straining of the skink to bite harder or of the snake to
shift its grip and work its jaws toward the skink's head. The racer
broke the skink's grip, and began to swallow it head first. When
only the hind legs and tail of the skink still protruded from the
racer's mouth, I lunged forward in an attempt to catch both
reptiles. With a sudden movement the snake disgorged the skink,
which darted away into the grass and escaped" (Fitch, 1955:78).</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="Composition_of_Food" id="Composition_of_Food"></a><i>Composition of Food</i></p>

<p>Many authors have contributed to knowledge of the racer's food
habits. In most instances the records have been few or casual, but
several intensive studies have been made, notably by Surface (1906)
in Pennsylvania, Ortenburger (1928) for the species as a whole,
Uhler, Cottam and Clark (1939) in Virginia, Clark (1949) in
Louisiana, Auffenberg (1949) in southern Texas, Hamilton and
Pollack (1956) in Georgia, and Klimstra (1959) in southern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
Illinois. However, the findings of different authors are not strictly
comparable; some have made general statements concerning the
food habits but have mentioned specific items only when these were
considered unusual. Certain authors have listed individual prey
animals eaten; others have indicated the percentages (in bulk or
in frequency) that the different kinds of prey comprised. Some
writers have identified food animals only in broad categories such
as "insect," "beetle" or "snake" while others have undertaken
specific determinations for all the prey or for certain taxonomic
groupings that were subjects of special interest.</p>

<div class="sm_text">
<p>For the eastern black racer (<i>C. c. constrictor</i>) the following food items
have been recorded: 1 robin (<i>Turdus migratorius</i>, Storer, 1839:226); 1 copperhead
(<i>Agkistrodon contortrix</i>, Verrill, 1869:158); 1 weasel (<i>Mustela</i> sp.&mdash;presumably
the diminutive <i>M. rixosa</i>&mdash;Atkinson, 1901:148); 3 undetermined
mammals, 1 rabbit, 1 undetermined mouse, 7 voles (2 <i>Microtus</i> sp., 4 <i>M.
pennsylvanicus</i>, 1 <i>Clethrionomys gapperi</i>), 1 undetermined bird, 2 robin eggs,
2 garter snakes (<i>Thamnophis sirtalis</i>), 1 water snake (<i>Natrix sipedon</i>), 1 grass
snake (<i>Opheodrys vernalis</i>), 1 green frog (<i>Rana clamitans</i>), 1 wood frog (<i>R.
sylvatica</i>), 1 grasshopper (<i>Melanoplus femur-rubrum</i>) 2 camel crickets
(<i>Ceuthophilus</i> sp.), 5 moths (cecropia, regal, imperial), 4 beetles, 1 currant
worm, 1 ichneumonid wasp (<i>Nematus ribesii</i>), 1 currant worm (Surface, 1906:170);
1 ribbon snake (<i>Thamnophis sauritus</i>, Ditmars, 1907:282); 3 snakes (1
<i>Liopeltis vernalis</i>, 1 <i>Storeria occipitomaculata</i>, 1 undetermined), 6 white-footed
mice (1 <i>Peromyscus leucopus</i>, 5 <i>P. nuttalli</i>), 1 vole (<i>Microtus pennsylvanicus</i>),
16 crickets (9 <i>Gryllus pennsylvanicus</i>, 4 <i>G. assimilis</i>, 2 <i>Miogryllus
verticalis</i>, 1 <i>Nemobius fasciatus</i>), 2 grasshoppers (<i>Dissosteira</i> sp.), 1 lepidopteran,
3 elaterid beetles (Ortenburger, 1928:200). Richmond and Goin
(1938:310) recorded finding the stomach of a black racer crammed with
June beetles (<i>Phyllophaga</i>). Conant (1938:53) recorded a black racer from
Ohio that had a smaller individual of its own species in its stomach. The
smaller snake contained a caterpillar. Uhler, Cottam and Clark (1939:34)
found food in 16 of 34 black racers from Virginia. Mammals, including a
shrew (<i>Blarina brevicauda</i>), a mole, a flying squirrel (<i>Glaucomys volans</i>), a
microtine, and a mouse (<i>Peromyscus</i> sp.) made up 26 per cent, 2 worm snakes
(<i>Carphophis amoenus</i>), 2 ring-necked snakes (<i>Diadophis punctatus</i>), and 1
water snake (<i>Natrix sipedon</i>) made up 25.6 per cent, 5 birds including a
warbler and a sparrow, made up 17.75 per cent; 2 frogs (<i>Rana</i> sp.) made up
9.38 per cent, 1 fence lizard (<i>Sceloporus undulatus</i>) made up 6.25 per cent,
and insects, including cicadas (<i>Tibicen</i> sp.) and larval lepidopterans, made
up 15.09 per cent. In Indiana, Minton (1944:457) examined 11 food-containing
stomachs; there were rodents in six, snakes in five, a tree frog in one,
and insects (cicadas, large grasshoppers) in four, and another black racer was
found swallowing a small box turtle (<i>Terrapene carolina</i>). In Maryland,
McCauley (1945:75) examined eight digestive tracts and recorded a shrew
(<i>Blarina brevicauda</i>) in one, an unidentified mammal in one, 2 small cicadas
in one, 2 small chickens in one, a fence lizard (<i>Sceloporus undulatus</i>) in one,
and frogs and toads (including <i>Hyla crucifer</i>) in one; a ninth snake had
eaten a half grown rat. In Connecticut, Finneran (1948:124) observed a
large black racer eating a 21-inch garter snake (<i>Thamnophis sirtalis</i>). Duellman
(1951:338) recorded a black racer in Greene County, Ohio, swallowing
a large garter snake (<i>Thamnophis sirtalis</i>). In Kentucky, Barbour (1950:104)
recorded remains of an unidentified snake in one stomach.</p>

<p>Many authors likewise have recorded food of the southern black racer
(<i>C. c. priapus</i>). In Georgia, Wright and Bishop (1915:160) recorded finding
2 racerunners (<i>Cnemidophorus sexlineatus</i>), a skink (<i>Lygosoma laterale</i>), 4
green tree frogs (<i>Hyla cinerea</i>) and 1 pine woods tree frog (<i>H. femoralis</i>) in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
stomachs. They also stated that the toad (<i>Bufo lentiginosus</i> [= <i>terrestris</i>])
was the most important article of food. Burt and Hoyle (1934:205) wrote
that a racer from Rogers County, Oklahoma, had eaten an adult male collared
lizard (<i>Crotaphytus collaris</i>). In Florida, Carr (1950:80) found one of these
black racers eating a leopard frog (<i>Rana pipiens</i>). Hamilton and Pollack
(1956:523) examined digestive tracts of 62 and found food in 57, comprising
the following percentages by volume: <i>Lygosoma laterale</i>, 34.2; <i>Eumeces
fasciatus</i> and <i>E. egregius</i>, 11.3; <i>Cnemidophorus sexlineatus</i>, 8.8; <i>Sceloporus
undulatus</i>, 3.5; undetermined lizard, 3.5; <i>Opheodrys aestivus</i>, 6.6; <i>Diadophis
punctatus</i>, 3.1; <i>Storeria dekayi</i>, 1.6; <i>Coluber constrictor</i>, 1.8; <i>Heterodon
platyrhinos</i>, 1.8; <i>Masticophis flagellum</i>, 1.8; <i>Rana</i> sp., 5.3; <i>Hyla cinerea</i>, 1.8;
<i>Hyla versicolor</i>, 1.8; <i>Peromyscus</i>, 1.8; undetermined rodent, 1.8; lepidopterous
larva, 1.7.</p>

<p>In southern Illinois in an intergrading population of racers intermediate
between <i>C. c. priapus</i> and <i>C. c. flaviventris</i>, Cagle (1942:188) examined several
stomachs and found 1 chipmunk (<i>Tamias striatus</i>), 2 voles (<i>Microtus</i> sp.),
2 mice (<i>Peromyscus</i> sp.), 2 green snakes (<i>Opheodrys</i> sp.), 1 water snake
(<i>Natrix sipedon</i>) and grasshoppers. From this same population Klimstra
(1959:212) examined 137 digestive tracts of which 115 contained food as
follows: 194 locustids, 118 gryllids, 17 undetermined beetles, 13 carabids,
6 scarabaeids, 10 lepidopterans, 9 hemipterans, 1 hymenopteran, 2 homopterans,
1 dipteran, 17 undetermined insects, 73 <i>Peromyscus</i> sp., 19 <i>Microtus
ochrogaster</i>, 9 <i>M. pinetorum</i>, 12 <i>Sylvilagus floridanus</i>, 3 <i>Scalopus aquaticus</i>, 3
<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>, 4 <i>Mus musculus</i>, 2 <i>Tamias striatus</i>, 2 <i>Synaptomys cooperi</i>,
16 <i>Rana pipiens</i>, 8 <i>Acris crepitans</i>, 2 <i>Rana clamitans</i>, 2 <i>R. palustris</i>, 1 <i>R.
catesbeiana</i>, 4 <i>Hyla crucifer</i>, 3 <i>Pseudacris nigrita</i>, 4 <i>Lampropeltis calligaster</i>,
4 <i>Sceloporus undulatus</i>, 4 <i>Chrysemys picta</i>, 1 <i>Heterodon platyrhinos</i>, 1 unidentified
reptile, 4 <i>Sturnella magna</i>, 1 <i>Otocoris alpestris</i>, 4 unidentified birds.
Percentages by volume of the various categories in this sample were: insects,
39.1; mammals, 32.9; amphibians, 10.8; reptiles, 8.3; birds, 6.3; miscellaneous,
2.6.</p>

<p>Food of the "buttermilk snake" (<i>C. c. anthicus</i>) is known only through
Clark's study (1949:249). In an unstated number of examinations he found
"mice" in 25, "rats" in five, lizards (<i>Sceloporus undulatus</i> and perhaps others)
in eight, frogs (<i>Rana pipiens</i>) in seven, and birds in three.</p>

<p>The food of <i>C. c. stejnegerianus</i> is known only from the work of Auffenberg
(1949) but his sample was based on 206 racers that had food, among the
total of 291 recorded. Unfortunately, he did not present actual numbers of
the various prey animals, but divided the food into seven categories and
listed these as percentages. He did not indicate whether the percentages
represented volumes or numbers of individual occurrences, and evidently
there was some error in computation since his combined percentages totalled
111. The categories and their percentages were as follows: grasshoppers,
42.5; crickets, 13.5; miscellaneous insects, .6; earless lizards (<i>Holbrookia</i> sp.),
40.1; scaly lizards (<i>Sceloporus</i> sp.) 2.1; frogs (<i>Rana</i> sp.) 10.0; rodents, 2.2.
Auffenberg divided his sample of racers into five size classes, and showed that
the smaller snakes fed chiefly on insects whereas vertebrates were increasingly
prominent in the food of the larger snakes.</p>

<p>The food of <i>C. c. mormon</i> is known chiefly through the work of Ortenburger
(1928:228) who cited instances of a skink (<i>Eumeces skiltonianus</i>) and a
young garter snake (<i>Thamnophis sirtalis</i>) being eaten, and listed the following
items from 24 stomachs that he examined: 7 decticids, 8 acridids, 5 oedipines,
1 tryxaline, 6 <i>Melanoplus</i> sp., 3 <i>M. mexicanus</i>, 2 <i>M. devastator</i>, 1 <i>M. bivittatus</i>,

pacificus</i>, 6 <i>Gammarotettix bilobatus</i> and 2 cicada nymphs. Grinnell,
Dixon and Linsdale (1930:149) found that one of these racers had eaten a
cricket. Fitch (1936:644) found another in the act of swallowing an adult vole
(<i>Microtus californicus</i>), and recorded (1935:18) that two alligator lizards
(<i>Gerrhonotus multicarinatus</i>) were found in the stomach of still another.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
Woodbury (1931:75) recorded that a racer from Utah had a sagebrush scaly
lizard (<i>Sceloporus graciosus</i>) in its stomach. Of the specimens examined in
the University of California Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, no. 17256 from
the Mad River, Trinity County, California, had eaten an alligator lizard
(<i>Gerrhonotus coeruleus</i>), and no. 10120 from Yolla Bolly Mountain in the
same county had eaten a bird (unidentified) and a Jerusalem cricket (<i>Stenopelmatus</i>
sp.).</p>

<p>Several authors have published specific information regarding the food of
<i>C. c. flaviventris</i>. Hurter (1911:171) caught a blue racer in the act of swallowing
a copperhead (<i>Agkistrodon contortrix</i>). Taylor (1892:331) recorded finding
garter snakes in several large racers. Pope and Dickinson (1928:53) recorded
instances of blue racers feeding on racerunners (<i>Cnemidophorus sexlineatus</i>).
Ortenburger (1928:181) examined 22 stomachs and recorded: 1
large garter snake (<i>Thamnophis sirtalis</i>), 1 vole (<i>Microtus pennsylvanicus</i>), 1
frog (<i>Rana</i> sp.), 31 crickets (<i>Gryllus assimilis</i>), 4 decticines, 2 acridids, grasshoppers
(1 <i>Hippiscus</i>, 2 <i>Melanoplus</i> sp., 1 <i>M. confusus</i>, 1 <i>M. differentialis</i>, 1
<i>Dissosteira carolina</i>, 1 <i>Sphargemon collare</i>, 1 <i>Trimerotropus</i> sp., 1 <i>Orphulella</i>
sp., 1 <i>Chloealtis conspersa</i>, 1 <i>Chortophaga viridifasciata</i>, 1 <i>Omaseus</i> sp., 1
<i>Pedocetes</i> sp.), and 2 caterpillars (1 noctuid, 1 sphingid). Gloyd (1928:123)
recorded a hatchling glass lizard (<i>Ophisaurus attenuatus</i>) in the stomach of
a juvenal racer. Force (1930:31) found a racer eating eggs from the nest of
a cardinal (<i>Richmondena cardinalis</i>) and another racer eating eggs of a red-wing
(<i>Agelaius phoeniceus</i>). Gloyd (1932:403) recorded an observation of
a racer overpowering and swallowing a copperhead. Anderson (1942:210)
recorded remains of crickets and grasshoppers in feces. Hudson (1942:55)
recorded a racerunner (<i>Cnemidophorus sexlineatus</i>) in the stomach of a
juvenile and recorded an earless lizard (<i>Holbrookia maculata</i>) 3 lizard eggs,
and 14 grasshoppers (<i>Melanoplus differentialis</i> and others) in the stomach of
another. Marr (1944:484) found a harvest mouse (<i>Reithrodontomys montanus</i>)
in one. Breckenridge (1944:118) recorded stomach contents including
a garter snake (<i>Thamnophis sirtalis</i>), a frog (<i>Rana pipiens</i>), 3 crickets and 2
moths. Mossimann and Rabb (1952:27) recorded that a racer disgorged
several grasshoppers. Fouquette and Lindsay (1955:411) recorded that a
blue racer had eaten a harvest mouse (<i>Reithrodontomys</i> sp.). Carpenter
(1958:114) recorded that one blue racer had eaten a green snake (<i>Opheodrys
aestivus</i>) and another had eaten a grasshopper and a camel cricket.</p>

<p>Even though the sets of data cited above are not entirely comparable,
certain trends are evident. The black racers of the eastern
states (especially <i>C. c. constrictor</i> of more northern regions) take a
high proportion of vertebrates in their prey. Among these vertebrates
snakes especially are well represented and the black snake
would seem to be of some importance as an ophiphagous predator.
The birds and mammals taken include some that are bulky (robin,
cottontail, and even a weasel&mdash;the most formidable prey eaten).
Presumably the rabbits that were eaten were young. In samples
from the eastern United States insects made up small to insignificant
parts of the food; they were lacking entirely or at least were not
mentioned in the samples examined by McCauley and Wright and
Bishop. In the blue racer of the central states, insects (mostly
grasshoppers and crickets) are much more prominent in the food
and vertebrates correspondingly less prominent. The vertebrates
eaten are largely lizards, small snakes and mice. <i>C. c. stejnegerianus</i>
is much like <i>flaviventris</i> in the trend of its feeding. <i>C. c. mormon</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
is less known than these subspecies in its feeding, but indications
are that it takes a higher proportion of orthopteran insects and
smaller proportions of mammals and snakes than do any of the other
subspecies.</p>

<p>In my own field study a total of 1357 food records were accumulated,
one of the largest samples known for any kind of snake.
Most of these records were from the small area where my population
study was carried on, and studies of other kinds of animals, including
those that were the racer's prey, were simultaneously in
progress. Because large collections of reference materials were
available, it was possible to identify to species many of the prey
items found, even though they were incomplete and highly fragmented
because most of them were recovered from fecal material.</p>

<p>The prey is, of course, swallowed entire, and the recently
swallowed items squeezed from the stomachs provide the best material
for the study of food habits. However, relatively few racers
had detectable food items in their stomachs; digestion is rapid and
often the snake was in a trap for a day or more before it was found.
Therefore the greater number of records were obtained from scats.
The residue in scats consisted entirely of hard and indigestible
parts such as the chitin of insects' exoskeletons and the hair, feathers,
scales, teeth and occasional bone fragments of the vertebrate
prey. The insects eaten could usually be counted individually by
sorting parts, such as heads or hind legs. With mammals, birds
and reptiles the hair, feathers, or scales did not permit counting of
individuals&mdash;each occurrence was assumed to represent one individual
but in some instances two or more may have been present.
Amphibians, lacking indigestible dermal structures were in most
instances not represented at all in the scats, since their tissues were
more or less completely dissolved by the digestion of the snakes.
Soft-bodied larvae of insects and other invertebrates conceivably
could be likewise completely digested, but such occurrences must
be rare, as most of the invertebrates known to be eaten have the
mouth parts, at least, heavily chitinized.</p>

<p>Admittedly the factors discussed above would cause some bias
in the percentage composition of the food determined from scats,
but I believe that the amount of error introduced was slight, because,
judging from the records of items from stomachs, amphibians
are not eaten frequently, and even mammals are not eaten frequently
enough so that there is much chance of a snake taking two
or more individuals at the same meal, unless it is robbing a nest
containing a litter of young.</p>

<p>The largest sample, based on 1008 food items, was obtained from

of prey in a sample of 69 food items squeezed out of stomachs of the
blue racers captured at Harvey County Park. Most of the items were vertebrates,
and lizards (<i>Cnemidophorus</i>) were especially prominent in the food at
this locality. Samples of prey from scats (included in Figs. <a href="#Fig_13">13</a> and <a href="#Fig_14">14</a>) and
from stomachs show somewhat different trends, and neither is entirely representative
of the actual feeding. Also, local differences in food sources are
important.</p>
</div>

<p>Over the same period that the sample of scats was collected, a
much smaller food sample of 73 prey items was collected by squeezing
recently eaten food from the racers' stomachs, or by finding the
snakes actually swallowing their prey. These items from stomachs
are listed separately because they include relatively more vertebrates
than do the items from scats. A grasshopper or cricket eaten
by a large racer might have passed undetected, while a relatively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
large item such as a vole or lizard would have produced a conspicuous
bulge in the snake that ate it, and would have excited the
curiosity of the investigator. A second difference is that the items
from stomachs included several frogs, whereas amphibians were
absent from the much larger sample from scats. A third difference
is that the many insects found in stomachs were all orthopterans
with the exceptions of three noctuid moths and the larva of a moth.
Miscellaneous insects, such as beetles, bees and ants recorded from
scats were not found in stomachs. Amphibians eaten are digested
so completely that no recognizable parts of them are to be found
in scats, but remains of the insects previously eaten by amphibians
are to be seen in racers' scats. If not recognized as secondary
items, such remains might lead to erroneous conclusions regarding
the racer's food.</p>

<div class="sm_text">
<p>The items from stomachs were as follows: 21 grasshoppers (5 oedipines, 4
tryxalines, 5 <i>Melanoplus bivittatus</i>, 3 <i>M. differentialis</i>, 1 <i>M. femur-rubrum</i> and
one each of <i>Chortophaga viridifasciata</i>, <i>Dissosteira carolina</i>, and <i>Sphargemon

white-footed mice (5 <i>Peromyscus leucopus</i> and 1 <i>P. maniculatus</i>), 4 harvest

<i>Thamnophis sirtalis</i>, 1 <i>Storeria dekayi</i>); 4 lizards (2 <i>Eumeces obsoletus</i>, 1
<i>Cnemidophorus sexlineatus</i>, 1 <i>Ophisaurus attenuatus</i>); 4 frogs (<i>Rana pipiens</i>),
1 tree-frog (<i>Hyla versicolor</i>).</p>

<p>Records from the Harvey County, Kansas study area include a series of 69
food items from 55 stomachs (of living snakes) and 210 food items from 113
scats. There is a relatively high proportion of vertebrates, including some
frogs, in the stomachs, and with no frogs but more miscellaneous insect material
in the scats. But, for the sake of brevity, the two categories of items are
combined in the following list: 55 grasshoppers (12 unspecified, 1 "locustid,"
31 "oedipines," 7 "tryxalines," 5 "locustines," 2 <i>Melanoplus bivittatus</i> and one
each of <i>M. femur-rubrum</i>, <i>M. scudderi</i>, <i>M. differentialis</i>, and <i>Arphia simplex</i>);
48 crickets (31 <i>Gryllus assimilis</i>, 17 unspecified); 14 katydids (11 <i>Daihinia
brevipes</i>, one each of rhadiphorine, conocephaline and <i>Neoconocephalus</i> sp.);
9 noctuid moths and 1 moth larva; 26 miscellaneous insects (including 13
"beetles," 1 elaterid, 1 curculionid, 1 lygaeid bug, 1 ant, 1 wasp); 1 spider, 7
mice (5 <i>Peromyscus maniculatus</i>, 2 unspecified), 4 unidentified mammals, 1

</div>


<p class="caption3"><a name="Kinds_of_Prey" id="Kinds_of_Prey"></a><i>Kinds of Prey</i></p>

<p>Throughout the range of the racer small mammals make up an
important portion of the food, and the bulk of those eaten are voles
(<i>Microtus</i> sp.) and white-footed mice (<i>Peromyscus</i> sp.). The
voles being diurnal, and having habitat preferences similar to those
of the racer, are especially subject to attack, but only large adult
racers are capable of swallowing a full grown vole. Probably most
of the voles eaten are immature. Of the white-footed mice, <i>P.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
maniculatus</i> especially prefers a grassland habitat, and is usually
found in situations frequented by the racer. Being mainly nocturnal
and crepuscular, it is usually in hiding at times when the racer is
prowling, but may be flushed from its nest in a shallow burrow or
beneath a sheltering object, and overtaken by the snake. Other
mammals that are important in the food are harvest mice and other
mice, shrews, and young cottontails. The latter are small enough
to be eaten by racers only in the early stages of their life in the nest
before weaning. Rats (<i>Rattus</i>, <i>Sigmodon</i>), moles, sciurids, and
weasels are less frequent prey, ordinarily too large to be eaten by
racers and taken chiefly as defenseless juveniles.</p>

<p>Predation on birds is relatively uncommon, and in most instances
it involves the eggs or nestlings, or fledglings still slow and clumsy
and incapable of sustained flight, or, occasionally, injured adults.
Nests that are vulnerable are chiefly those of ground nesting species,
or of kinds that nest near the ground in grass or thickets. Many of
the birds recorded have not been identified to species, but those
identified have included a variety of small passerines and also
domestic chicks.</p>

<p>Lizards figure prominently in most of the food samples, but only
a few species, those that live on or near the ground in grassy places,
have been recorded. Most of the records pertain to scaly lizards
(<i>Sceloporus undulatus</i> and <i>S. graciosus</i>), earless lizards (mainly or
entirely <i>Holbrookia maculata</i>), racerunners (<i>Cnemidophorus sexlineatus</i>)
and skinks (<i>Lygosoma laterale</i> and <i>Eumeces</i> sp.).</p>

<p>Snakes are important in the racer's food in most parts of the
range, but the large racers of the Northeast are those most inclined
to ophiphagous habits. The common garter snake (<i>Thamnophis
sirtalis</i>) is the species most commonly eaten. Probably this is a
matter of availability rather than preference, since the garter snake
is one of the commonest and most widely distributed of North
American snakes, occurring throughout most of the racer's range.
The green snakes (<i>Opheodrys</i>) also are represented frequently.
The other snakes eaten are mostly medium-sized to small colubrids,
of a variety of kinds. However, there are three records (from
Connecticut, Missouri and Kansas) of the racer preying on the
venomous copperhead. There are many records of the racer preying
on smaller individuals of its own species. In my own records
racer remains appeared 18 times, equalling in frequency those of the
common garter snake and exceeding all other kinds. In four of
these instances the scale remains were relatively few and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
scales were relatively large, suggesting as an alternative to actual
predation that a racer may have eaten part of its own sloughed skin,
or that patches of shed skin may have adhered to the scat after its
deposition in the trap. However, in the remaining 14 instances the
remains of racer found in scats clearly indicated cannibalism, since
the scales found were small and numerous and often were associated
with bone. Cannibalism seems to occur frequently enough to be
a significant factor in the reduction of the first year young. Liner
(1949:230) described two instances of cannibalism in a litter of
blue racers hatched in captivity. In one instance two young had
seized the same lizard, and one having swallowed the lizard, continued
to engulf the other snake, although it was of a size approximately
equal to that of the first snake. Nevertheless, swallowing
was completed, with the snake eaten pressed in a series of curves.
A second instance of cannibalism occurred when one young racer
attempting to catch a lizard struck another racer by mistake, then
retained its hold and commenced swallowing. A similar instance
was observed in a brood that I kept in 1962 after hatching had occurred
in the laboratory.</p>

<p>Hatchling turtles of two kinds (<i>Chrysemys picta</i>, <i>Terrapene
carolina</i>) have been reported in the racer's food. Probably other
kinds are eaten also. However, the awkward shape and almost inflexible
shell of the prey on the one hand, and the slender form of
the racer, with limited distensibility of the gullet on the other,
would limit this type of predation to occasional instances involving
an unusually large racer and a small turtle.</p>

<p>There seem to be no records of the racer preying on salamanders.
Many kinds of frogs are eaten, chiefly ranids and hylids, and the
leopard frog (<i>Rana pipiens</i>) is the most frequent victim. Wright
and Bishop (1915:160) stated that the toad (<i>Bufo terrestris</i>) occupied
first place in the racer's food in the region of Okefinokee
Swamp, Georgia, but they mentioned no specific instances of this
species being eaten. Klimstra (<i>loc. cit.</i>) found only four toads in
his large sample of digestive tracts from Illinois. Because of their
virulent dermal secretions, bufonid toads are avoided by many kinds
of snakes and predation on them by the racer probably is unusual.</p>

<p>Most authors who have written concerning the food habits of the
racer have mentioned insects as part of the diet. Statements in the
literature have often seemed to imply that the racer feeds on insects
in general, according to their availability. However, the
large number of records now available demonstrate that the racer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
is highly selective in choice of its insect food, that soft-bodied
orthopterans, chiefly crickets, grasshoppers and katydids, are the
usual insect prey, with occasional predation on moths and their
larvae. Eating of other insects such as cicadas and June beetles,
is a rarity, but on occasion a racer may be tempted to sample such
prey when it finds the newly emerged imago before its exoskeleton
has hardened. I am convinced that such rarely occurring items as
carabid beetles, hemipterans, homopterans, diplopods and spiders
are secondary prey items, eaten by frogs that later were eaten by
the snakes, in most instances if not in all. It is noteworthy that
several of the same genera of grasshoppers and crickets are prominent
in the food samples collected in widely separated parts of
the racer's range.</p>

<p>As might have been anticipated, different species of prey were
not utilized by the racers to the same extent throughout the
snakes' season of activity. Grasshoppers, for instance, fluctuated
from a low of 25.3 per cent (frequency) in the May sample to a
high of 41.4 per cent in the September sample. Availability of
prey, rather than any change of preference on the part of the
racer, explains this trend. Thus, the locust, <i>Arphia simplex</i>, which,
unlike most local grasshoppers, overwinters in the adult stage, is
most prominent in the food in May, represented by 15.7 per cent,
but it decreases progressively to a low of 1.8 per cent in September.
The common grasshoppers of the genus <i>Melanoplus</i> show just the
opposite trend, increasing during the summer, from a low of 2.62
per cent in May (when all are nymphs and most are too small to
constitute a meal worthy of a racer's attention) to a high of 31.5 per
cent in September. Mammals are best represented in the food in
May, when they collectively comprise nearly 30 per cent of the
items taken, and they are progressively less well represented as the
summer advances. Both <i>Microtus</i> and <i>Peromyscus</i> conform to this
trend, but the relative numbers of <i>Peromyscus</i> rise again abruptly
in October. The general trend may be explained by the fact that
in May most small mammal populations have a high proportion of
young of the year, and these young are especially vulnerable to
predation by the snakes. Also, insects in general are less available
in spring, and this may force the racers to utilize vertebrates to a
greater extent than at other seasons. Actually, the seasonal changes
in food sources are not especially striking, and it seems that each
important prey species is utilized more or less throughout the season
of the racer's activity.</p>

<p>The wide disparity in size between young and adult racers also
results in utilization of different food sources to some extent. In
some kinds of snakes adults and young draw their food from entirely
different sources, but in the racer there is broad overlap, as
shown in <a href="#Table_6">Table 6</a>. The samples from the largest and smallest size
groups of racers are relatively small. Two important kinds of prey&mdash;voles
and grasshoppers of the genus <i>Melanoplus</i>&mdash;were not found
at all in the smallest size groups of snakes and comprised increasing
percentages in the food of the larger size groups. A large adult
vole is too large to be swallowed except by an unusually large racer,
and a young vole old enough to leave its nest is far too large for a
hatchling racer. Grasshoppers of the genus <i>Melanoplus</i> are relatively
large and heavily armored, and so are relatively immune to
attacks from the smaller snakes. Small soft-bodied orthopterans including
<i>Gryllus</i>, <i>Ceuthophilus</i> and <i>Orchelimum</i>, and also lizards
and snakes, are best represented in the food of the smaller racers.
Other types of prey showed no definite correlation with size of
the racer taking them.</p>

<p class="caption3"><a name="Sexual_Behavior" id="Sexual_Behavior"></a><i>Sexual Behavior</i></p>

<p>Many observers have published accounts of the courtship and/or
mating of the racer, but all of these are, to some degree, incomplete.
Because of the widely different circumstances, and the different
viewpoints of the observers involved, the several accounts give
much different impressions of sexual behavior in this species.
Either singly or combined, the published accounts do not provide
an adequate description of the process.</p>

<p>My own observations, made both under natural conditions and
in large outdoor enclosures, are likewise somewhat incomplete, but
indicate that the whole sequence of courtship and mating is divisible
into the following well-defined stages: 1) the finding of a receptive
female by the male; 2) the persistent following of the female by
the male, who courts her by lying extended along her body and
performing writhing movements, with periodic interruptions during
which he momentarily leaves the female and courses rapidly
through the grass around her; 3) the acceptance of the male by
the female, signalled by the raising of her tail and the almost instantaneous
intromission; 4) the dragging of the passive male by
the female while he is firmly attached to her during the period of
coitus; 5) separation of the pair and involution of the male's
hemipenis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span></p>

<p>Even in the breeding season, racers that were confined in enclosures
usually were either indifferent to each other or responded
with reactions of fear or hostility. In moving they tended to follow
the edges, and often two moving in opposite directions would
approach each other; when this occurred, one snake might strike at
the other with a short jab that seemed to be mostly bluff, and then
would dart away. The males, being smaller, were usually the more
wary.</p>

<p>Sexual behavior was noticed on only a few occasions. Several
large adult males were less wary than others and usually manifested
curiosity or interest toward other racers. My most complete observations
of sexual behavior were made on May 18, 1962, when a
newly caught adult male was added to an enclosure of 100-foot
circumference already containing several racers, two of which were
large adult females. Within half an hour the male was found courting
one of the females. She was lying in a loose coil, with the male
extended along her. At my approach the female darted away in
alarm for approximately three feet, and the male moved with her,
so swiftly and adroitly that he maintained contact and was in approximately
his original position with respect to the female when
she stopped.</p>

<p>Spasmodic rippling movements passed down the body of the
male as he lay in contact with the female. These movements lasted
several seconds, increasing in intensity, alternating with longer
periods of little or no movement. As each period of vigorous
writhing reached its climax, the male's head jerked forward and
backward several times in seeming excitement. The female's behavior
was mostly passive. She seemed to be receptive, but from
time to time, without any noticeable warning, she darted away for
several feet as she had when the pair was first discovered. Each
time the male darted forward with her, maintaining contact while
she moved. These swift movements of the female seemed to be
spontaneous, at least in most instances there was no evident cause
for alarm. The female's movements seemed to stimulate the male's
interest rather than to discourage him. In most instances the
female moved only four to five feet, then stopped abruptly or
turned back. She would stop in a loose resting coil, in thick grass,
with the male lying over her. Often she coiled in such a way that
the posterior end of her body was beneath her forebody, but this
did not seem to deter the male from moving the posterior end of
his body into position beside hers. After a sudden change in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
female's position, the rear of the male's body would perform groping
movements along that of the female until his cloacal region was
approximately opposite hers. The male sometimes had his chin
pressed against the female's back, especially when he was moving
forward along her, but more often his head was raised, and
frequently was as much as 18 inches from the female's head.</p>

<p>At intervals averaging approximately ten minutes, during a little
more than an hour of observation, the male would suddenly dart
away from the female, and with unusually rapid and animated
movements, he would move around her in an irregular and devious
course, sometimes as far as five feet away, but usually within 18
inches. Usually on each such expedition several or many circuits
were made; then the male would return to the female and would
glide rapidly along her until he attained the mating position. A
period of especially vigorous courting movements would follow.</p>

<p>At 12:55 p. m. it was necessary for me to discontinue observations,
and I left the female confined in a cloth bag. Returning at
1:20 p. m. I found that the male was not displaying interest in the
female confined in the bag, nor in the other female loose in the enclosure.
The first female was released from the bag, and was out
of sight for approximately four minutes. When relocated she was
again attended by the male, who was carrying on courtship even
more vigorously than he had before. At 1:35 p. m. the male
achieved intromission. Although the pair was under observation
at the time intromission occurred, the actual eversion of the hemipenis
was not seen because the snakes were partly concealed by
dense vegetation. There was a sudden flurry of movement, the
male's head waving and his body thrashing. In an instant these
violent movements subsided, and after a few seconds the female began
to crawl forward slowly. The male had relaxed, and relinquished
his contact with the female anteriorly. As she moved
away he was dragged after her tail-first. He made slight backward
wriggling movements that perhaps aided in maintaining sexual
contact. The female's restlessness increased, and in eight minutes
she dragged the male in a circuitous course a distance estimated to
be between 20 and 30 feet. At 1:40 p. m. the pair was ten feet
from the point where copulation had begun. The female showed
increasing inclination to climb, raising her head and forebody
against the trunks of saplings, and finally reaching up one to a
branch 20 inches above the ground, and climbing first along the
branch and then farther up the main trunk. As she progressed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
male was lifted from the ground, dangling limply suspended by his
hemipenis and its base had become exposed. At 1:43 p. m. separation
occurred and the male dropped into the grass. Semen dripped
from the cloacae of both snakes. That from the female was tinged
with blood. The individuals involved in this observation were
kept in the enclosure subsequently but no further sexual behavior
was noted.</p>

<p>Contrary to the popular belief that these racers have permanent
mates, all available evidence indicates that they are promiscuous,
and two or more males may simultaneously court the same female
in the brief spring breeding season. On May 24, 1960, while I
was walking in a hilltop field of brome grass, a sudden movement
attracted my attention to three racers lying alongside each other.
Only the posterior parts of their bodies and their tails were visible.
Two were males and were performing the characteristic slow writhing
movements against the body of the female from either side.
Although the heads were not in view, the snakes may have been
able to see me through the screening vegetation; after I had
watched for approximately 20 seconds, all three suddenly took
alarm, for no apparent cause, and scattered.</p>

<p>Further evidence of promiscuity is provided by the account of
Ellicott (1880:207) who wrote regarding the eastern subspecies:
"I noticed a ball of black snakes (<i>Bascanion constrictor</i> L) rolling
slowly down a steep and stony hillside ... about two miles
above Union Factory, Baltimore County, Md. ... kept together
by procreative impulses." It was stated that this observation
was made in early spring. "Snake balls" have often been observed,
and described in the literature; usually the snakes involved
were garter snakes (<i>Thamnophis</i>) or water snakes (<i>Natrix</i>). Seemingly,
typical aggregations consist of a single adult female and
several or many males attempting to mate with her. There is a
distinct possibility that the snakes involved in Ellicott's observations
were misidentified.</p>

<p>Sexual behavior of the racer is in most respects remarkably
similar to that of the common garter snake, <i>Thamnophis sirtalis</i>,
well known through the work of Blanchard and Blanchard (1942).
In studying sexual behavior of racers, several observers have failed
to differentiate between the different stages of the mating process,
and have assumed that copulation was occurring when actually
only the precopulatory behavior was observed. In an early description
of courtship in this racer in Kansas, Brons (1882:365) stated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
that the female "at times, seems to toy with the male, indisposed
to yield to his importunities, though pressed with ardor. To avoid
his suit, at times, she will dart through grass, among stones, or
enter a crevice. Should he be able to reach his mate while within
a hole, he is not slow in bringing her to the surface, again to be
repulsed. Upon an unbroken ground the sexual union is less prolonged.
Here she is unable to free herself from his quick and
effectively directed moves. In case she attempts to quit him, a coil
is thrown about her body, and his head laid flat upon her neck, and
replaced as promptly as dislodged, evidently in the endeavor to
propitiate her."</p>

<p>Another account probably based on courtship rather than copulation
is that of Wright and Wright (1957:135), who described the
behavior of a pair of <i>C. c. priapus</i> on Billy Island, Okefinokee
Swamp in southern Georgia, on May 8, 1921, as follows: "They
were stretched out, more or less coiled ... the rear parts of
the bodies from the vent were entwined. The female, or smaller
one seemed to have its tail around that of the male. There were
contortions or quiverings from time to time.... May 8, 1921:
Jackson Lee saw black snakes entwined, the male seizing the female
by the top of the neck."</p>

<p>Blanchard and Blanchard (<i>op. cit.</i>) have described the dragging
of the male by the female during coitus in the garter snake, and the
temporarily inseparable bond formed between members of a pair
by the recurved spines of the engorged hemipenis, but it has not
been generally recognized that the process is much the same in other
colubrines. Cottam (1937:229) described and photographed mating
in a pair of <i>C. c. mormon</i> in Utah. The copulating racers were
shown in a loose coil lying alongside each other with tails intertwined.
However, when disturbed by the observers, these racers
made frantic efforts to escape, crawling in a spiral course, while
remaining attached and intertwined, "with no evident attempt to
separate" during approximately a quarter hour of observation.</p>

<p>The racer is notorious for its aggressive behavior and occasional
alleged attacks on humans in the breeding season. The tendency
has doubtless been much exaggerated, especially in the verbal
second- or third-hand accounts based on the alleged observations
of eye-witnesses. Nevertheless, the supposition that large adults
will sometimes pursue or attack humans when disturbed is well
substantiated. In most of the instances known to me, it is the large
eastern subspecies, <i>C. c. constrictor</i>, involved in these incidents, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
seemingly the smaller racers of the Middle West, far West and
South are less inclined to behave aggressively. In May 1958 two
pairs of large racers were confined in a semicircular wire enclosure
thirty feet across and open on top, and with natural vegetation, at
the Reservation headquarters. Often in approaching the cage I
saw two or more racers in close association, but because of sheltering
vegetation, and the snakes' timidity observation was difficult.
On May 19 a pair were lying partly extended in loose coils, but
immediately the female took alarm and darted away, breaking loose
from the male; his hemipenis was exposed, and underwent involution
and retraction in approximately 30 seconds. Unlike the female,
the male on this occasion did not attempt to escape, but turned to
face me with a show of aggressiveness. Probably copulation was in
its final stages when the disturbance occurred.</p>

<p>Circling of the female racer by the male from time to time in the
course of courtship has not been recognized by previous observers
as a part of the mating pattern, but Pope (1944:171) described
somewhat analogous behavior, probably modified by unnatural conditions
of captivity and the crowding of many racers in one cage.
Pope, citing earlier observations by Noble, wrote: "When sexually
excited, the male blacksnakes dash wildly about before paying court
to individual females. In captivity these dashes excite all specimens
confined together. A male, after picking out a mate, moves his chin
lightly along her back, while undulations run forward along his
sides and he extends his tongue now and then. Later he throws
the part of his body near his vent over the corresponding part of
the female, the two tails sometimes becoming loosely intertwined."</p>

<p>Recorded dates of mating for the species are all in spring, but
indicate a span of many weeks for the breeding season, and this
spread results in part from geographical differences. Published
records are as follows:</p>

<p>In the course of my live-trapping, I occasionally found more than
one racer in a trap. As might be expected from the low yield per
trap, such double or multiple captures were relatively rare. Chance,
and unusually strategic placement of certain traps were doubtless
contributing factors. May and October, being the most productive
months for trapping, yielded a high proportion of these combined
captures. Some involved an adult and an immature snake, or two
adults of the same sex. Eliminating all these, there remain 44
heterosexual captures of adults. These latter captures are significantly
concentrated in their seasonal distribution and indicate a
spring breeding season; 34 were in May, six were in June and four
were in October. Eight of the May records and one June record
each involved a trio of snakes&mdash;two males and a female in every
instance. Distribution of the spring records, grouped in five-day
intervals, was as follows:</p>

<p>Approximately 87 per cent of the records fell in the twenty-day
interval, May 11 to 30, which is regarded as the main breeding
season. Presumably males continue to be at the peak of breeding
condition and continue to search for females after the latter have
become unreceptive, partly explaining the scattering of records
through most of June.</p>

<p>Several of the females found in traps with males in May had
abundant active sperm in their cloacae and oviducts and probably
had been inseminated within a few hours of the time they were
checked. Others lacked sperm, but the cramped quarters inside the
traps may have effectively prevented the consummation of courtship,
especially when two males were confined with the same female.
None of the females trapped with males in October was
found to be inseminated, and it seems doubtful whether copulation
ever occurs at that time of year, although males have motile sperm
and seem to be in breeding condition then.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="Cycle_of_the_Male" id="Cycle_of_the_Male"></a><i>Cycle of the Male</i></p>

<p>Cloacal smears indicate that males mature sexually and first produce
sperm in August and September when they are a little more
than a year old. Insofar as could be determined, there was no
sexual activity at this time of year, and actual breeding of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
adolescent racers was postponed until the following May. By this
time at an average age of 20 months, the snakes had made further
growth.</p>

habitats, at Harvey County Park (upper) and at Reservation and
Rockefeller Tract (lower). Intensive activity in spring (the breeding
season), tapering off rapidly as the season advances, is well
shown by the larger sample, but in the years of trapping at Harvey
County Park operations usually were not fully underway until the
latter part of May.</p>

<p>Mr. Dwight R. Platt studied the changes in the male reproductive
organs during the annual cycle at Harvey County. In racers
recently emerged from hibernation he found the seminiferous
tubules filled with Sertoli syncytium, but containing few germ cells.
Spermatogonia proliferate in May and June. During the first half
of July primary spermatocytes are the dominant cells in the seminiferous
tubules. By early August spermatids are dominant and
the first free spermatozoa are present. In late October spermiogenesis
is essentially complete and the tubules are relatively empty
before the snakes hibernate. During the season of activity the
seminiferous tubules increase to approximately double their minimum
diameter, reaching the maximum in August. Cyclic changes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
in size and secretory activity of the ductus deferens, ductus
epididymis, and sexual segment of the renal tubules occur, with
maximum size and secretory activity coinciding with the time of
movement and storage of the spermatozoa. The latter are stored
in both ductus deferens and ductus epididymis. Despite the short
breeding season, a male racer has active sperm at all seasons.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="Eggs" id="Eggs"></a><i>Eggs</i></p>

<p>In accounts of the racer in the humid southeastern United States,
Brimley (1903:261), Wright and Bishop (1915:160) and Tinkle
(1959:195) mentioned the ease with which the eggs might be
found and the superficial situations in which they were sometimes
deposited. Both Wright and Bishop, and Tinkle made field studies
in swamps, where presumably the subsoil was saturated with
moisture and too wet for the eggs. Tinkle mentioned finding one
clutch beneath a discarded newspaper and another beneath a
small, thin board. Surface (1906:167) stated that in Pennsylvania
the eggs were to be found in loose soil, in sawdust piles, or in decaying
wood of hollow logs or trees. Clark (1949:249) stated that
in northern Louisiana the eggs are laid in soft, moist soil such as
may be found beside decaying logs. Minton (1944:457) found two
clutches under flat stones on hillsides in Indiana. In the more arid
climates of the far western states the species' habits are much different
in this regard. Through many years of familiarity with <i>C. c.
mormon</i>, I have never seen its eggs. Presumably nests in this part
of the range are deep underground, most often in old burrows of the
pocket gopher (<i>Thomomys</i>), which are so abundant that in many
areas the soil is riddled with them. Burrows of the ground squirrels
(<i>Spermophilus</i> sp.) and other small digging mammals also provide
potential insulated nest sites with the favorably moderate temperatures
and high humidities that the eggs of snakes require.</p>

<p>On the morning of July 10, 1962, I was directed to the sites of
two clutches recently plowed up, 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> miles north of the Reservation
(<a href="#Plate_21_Fig_2">Pl. 21, Fig. 2</a>). The eggs were in a fallow field having a stand of
sunflowers three to five feet high. The plow blades turned the soil
at a depth of approximately seven inches. In each instance only
a few eggs were visible. They were well scattered in the loose soil
turned up by the plow; 21 were found in one clutch and 10 in the
other. All the eggs were intact except two that had minute punctures
from which liquid oozed. Seemingly the eggs <i>in situ</i> had
been well above the level of the blade&mdash;at depths of four to five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
inches. No nest cavities were discernible where the eggs were
found, but elsewhere in the field tunnels of moles (<i>Scalopus
aquaticus</i>) and prairie voles (<i>Microtus ochrogaster</i>) were exposed
by the plow. Presumably the eggs had been in such tunnels, which
had disappeared as the loose soil crumbled. Another clutch was
discovered in an adjoining field on July 16. The nine eggs were
at depths ranging from 6<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> to nine inches, and only the two topmost
eggs had been turned up by the plow. All three clutches
were within a few feet of the edges of the fields.</p>

<p>On the Reservation and nearby areas I have seen remains of an
estimated 20 clutches that have been destroyed by predators. The
remains in every instance consisted of an excavation, and the strewn
torn and empty eggshells. Nests were at depths of four to eight
inches in old tunnels, which most often seemed to be those of moles
but also included some of the prairie vole, and perhaps some of the
pine vole (<i>Microtus pinetorum</i>). All these nests were in open
sunny places in prairie or pasture habitat.</p>

<p>Many observers have described the eggs of the racer, which are
white, elliptical, somewhat elongate, with tough, leathery, somewhat
flexible, shells, and a granular surface. Like other snake eggs,
those of the racer gradually absorb moisture during incubation.
They become more turgid and increase in weight and dimensions,
especially in breadth, and by the time of hatching are nearly twice
their size at laying. Between different clutches and even within
the same clutch there is notable variation in the size of the newly
laid eggs. Munro (1948:199) noted that in a small adult racer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
kept by him, the eggs laid were larger but less numerous than those
produced by a large adult. Munro noted also that shape of eggs in
the two clutches differed; the smaller snake produced more elongate
eggs of smaller diameter. The idea that eggs laid by the smaller
females are more slender and elongate is not supported by my own
data. For 11 clutches of eggs examined soon after laying, dimensions,
weights, and the lengths of the females are shown in <a href="#Table_7">Table 7</a>.</p>

<p>In a clutch of eggs beginning to hatch on September 3, 1958,
dimensions and weights were as follows: length 31.8 (36-30),
diameter 22.0 (24-21), weight 9.7 (10.3-9.3).</p>

<p>Gravid females that were kept in captivity in anticipation of their
laying usually produced their clutches within a few days. The laying
dates of such individuals are shown in the following list. Those
with asterisks were from the Harvey County study area, others were
from the Reservation and Rockefeller Tract.</p>

<p>A further indication of the period when laying occurs was provided
by the appearance of females gravid and progressively more
swollen with eggs, then their abrupt disappearance and replacement
by thin and wrinkled individuals that obviously were recently
parturient. The following records show the course of these events
on the Reservation in the years when summer trapping was done
with sufficient consistency. These dates provide a rough approximation
of the time when laying occurs locally. They indicate a
laying season concentrated in a period of approximately three weeks
in this locality. Records from published literature also indicate that
laying occurs in late June and early July at the latitude of Kansas,
but somewhat earlier in the southern United States.</p>

clutch in the racer, on the basis of those found in the field, those
laid after capture, or those dissected from gravid females. Some
of the statements were based upon small but unspecified samples,
and are far from the mark. From records accumulated in the course
of my own field work, and a summarization of those in published

<p>In general, the number of eggs in the clutch is proportional to the
size of the female producing them. The larger and bulkier females
produce more eggs. Geographic trends in number of eggs produced
are perhaps controlled by differences in size between different populations;
thus, the large eastern <i>constrictor</i> produces nearly three
times as many eggs per clutch as does the small western <i>mormon</i>,
whereas the centrally located <i>flaviventris</i> is somewhat intermediate
in size and in numbers of eggs produced.</p>

<p>In most reptiles growth in length and bulk continues after attainment
of sexual maturity. For many kinds including <i>Eumeces fasciatus</i>,
<i>Crotaphytus collaris</i>, <i>Cnemidophorus sexlineatus</i>, <i>Agkistrodon
contortrix</i> (Fitch, 1954:60; 1956:236; 1958:36; 1960:174), and
<i>Sceloporus olivaceus</i> (Blair, 1960:94), it has been shown that the
larger and older females in a population produce more offspring
than do the smaller and younger individuals. This situation applies
in the racer, as shown by the clutches of 52 females correlated
with their sizes and presumed ages (<a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>, <a href="#Table_10">Table 10</a>).
The two-year-olds contribute a relatively small quota to the annual
brood, partly because their clutches are small, but more especially
because many of them fail to attain sexual maturity in time to
breed. Many of the female racers that are more than two years
old also fail to produce an annual clutch of eggs. The 24-day
period May 28 to June 20 inclusive is judged to comprise the period
when eggs have generally enlarged sufficiently to be detected in
gravid females, but still have not been laid in most instances. In
this period, in 1960, 1961 and 1962, ratios of gravid females to those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
not detectably gravid in several supposed age groups arbitrarily
established on the basis of size, were as follows:</p>

<p>Under unfavorable conditions eggs can be resorbed, but probably
this can occur only if initiated before ovulation. A racer in
which six small eggs were palped on June 28, 1960, was kept until
July 23 but did not oviposit. It no longer appeared gravid and the
ova could not be detected by palpation. Another female had 13
eggs on June 21, 1960, but by July 23 when the snake was released
the eggs had not been laid and no longer could be detected.
Both snakes refused to feed throughout their confinement.</p>

<p>Like other reptilian eggs, those of the racer are dependent upon
the warmth of their surroundings for incubation. They are tolerant
of a wide range of environmental temperatures, but the higher
the temperature the more rapidly incubation proceeds. Under
natural conditions there may be much difference in hatching time in
two clutches laid at the same time and in the same locality. Site of
the nest&mdash;deep and well insulated, or shallow; in a well shaded situation
or one exposed to maximum amounts of sunshine&mdash;would
largely control rates of development. Clark (1949:249) writing of
the subspecies <i>anthicus</i> in north-central Louisiana, stated: "eggs
are laid about the first of June.... young begin to make their
appearance at about ... July 1." Even for the southern
states these dates of laying and hatching seem somewhat too early
to reconcile with the records published by other observers, and are
in need of verification, especially since they seem to be based upon
vaguely remembered observations rather than upon written records.
At the other extreme Surface (1906:167) wrote of <i>constrictor</i> in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
Pennsylvania that hatching may occur as late as October, and that
there is evidence some young may even remain in the egg over
winter before hatching occurs. Several incubation periods are on
record for clutches laid and hatched in captivity, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>C. c. mormon</i>, Oregon, 47 and 51 days (laid July 3, 1961, hatched August
19 and 23; Van de Velde, Martan and Risley, 1962:212).</p>

<p>Detailed observations on hatching were made on a clutch of eggs
laid on June 29 and 30, 1962, by a female caught in Harvey County.
The first egg in the clutch had already been laid in the trap when
the female was found at 11:30 a. m., June 29. Two of the eggs were
abnormal, with thin transparent shells, and were found to lack
embryos when they were opened on July 7. Later, two other eggs
were attacked by mold and the embryos died early in development.
The clutch was kept in a can of slightly damp soil. At 2:30 p. m.
on August 13, when the clutch was examined, egg no. 6 was found
to have hatched. The young snake had made a 21-millimeter slit
in the shell. At 12:50 a. m. on August 14, it was discovered that
eggs 1, 4, 5 and 7 each had been slit. No. 4 had two parallel slits
separated by a two-millimeter strip of shell, and the young racer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
could be seen inside. At 1:05 a. m. this young snake had changed
position and was lying upside down in the egg, his snout protruding
slightly through one of the slits. At 1:45 a. m. he was again right
side up, still in the shell. At this time each of the slit eggs showed
the protruding snout of a young snake. Occasionally the viscous
liquid egg white would be blown into a large bubble on the surface
of the shell as the young snake exhaled. A third slit, parallel to the
others, had appeared in egg no. 4. A hatchling emerged from egg
no. 1 between 2:20 and 3:20 a. m., and another from no. 7 between
7:00 and 9:00 a. m. The hatchling struck vigorously many times,
and vibrated his tail when he was disturbed. Egg no. 3 was first
slit between 7:00 and 9:00 a. m., and three more slits appeared in
it between 9:15 and 10:15 a. m. At 12:45 p. m. a hatchling was
found in the act of emerging from egg no. 4, and approximately the
anterior one-fourth of its body protruded. Disturbed by the movements
of the observer, the little snake drew back into its shell. This
hatchling began to emerge again at 12:50 and his hatching was completed
at 1:00 p. m. Between 5:40 and 6:20 p. m. a hatchling
emerged from egg no. 3 (for several hours this hatchling had been
lying on its back inside the egg, with only its snout protruding);
two slits appeared in egg no. 2 and three slits appeared in egg no.
8. At 6:50 p. m. the hatchling in the latter thrust his snout through
the slit in this eggshell. This hatchling was lying on its back at
first but by 10:50 it had shifted to a normal position. It emerged
from the shell between 2:35 and 2:50 a. m. Egg no. 2 was the last
to hatch. At 7:05 p. m. the hatchling inside made two additional
small slits in the shell, and at 7:30 p. m. thrust its snout through one
of them, while lying on its back. At 1:45 a. m. it was right side
up, but at 3:00 a. m. had reverted to its previous position. At 4:40
a. m. it was again right side up, and it emerged from the shell at 5:55
p. m.</p>

<p>On August 17, at 11:00 a. m., hatchlings no. 5 and no. 6 had lost
their egg teeth. All others still had their egg teeth then, but by
10:00 p. m. that of no. 8 was missing, and that of no. 4 was loose
and dropped out while the snake was being handled. On August
20 at 9:00 a. m., hatchling no. 7 had lost its egg tooth; nos. 2 and 3
retained theirs only in part, and no. 1 had its egg tooth intact. By
noon on August 22 no trace of an egg tooth remained on any of the
hatchlings.</p>

<p>In the same group of hatchlings sign of impending molt was first
noticed on the morning of August 17, when no. 6 was noted to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
its eyes clouded and milky in appearance. By evening no. 1 had
attained the same stage and no. 7 was beginning to show it. On
the morning of August 20, shedding had begun in no. 6, while no. 2
and no. 8 had milky eyes. The eyes had cleared in no. 1 and no.
7, and were still clear in the remaining hatchlings. On August 22
shedding had been completed by no. 1 and no. 8, and all others
were in the process of shedding.</p>

<p>Another clutch of 14 eggs from a recently captured female was
found freshly laid in a cage on July 6, 1962. Hatching of 13 occurred
August 16 to 20, as shown in <a href="#Table_11">Table 11</a>.</p>

<p>Hatching usually occurs in late August or early September, and
the disparity in size between hatchlings and adults is greater than
in some other kinds of snakes. In 76 young from ten clutches of
eggs incubated in the laboratory, averages and extremes for measurements
and weights were as follows: snout-vent length, 214.5
(186 to 244) millimeters; tail, 59.3 (44 to 73) millimeters; weight,
4.16 (2.4 to 5.8) grams. In each brood the size tended to be
fairly uniform, except that there were usually one or more stunted
individuals markedly smaller than the others. However, there were
striking differences in size between the young of different broods.
None of the young captured was as small as the average hatchling
from the clutches incubated in captivity, but in the 14 years of my
study only four young were captured in August. The hatchlings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
are relatively secretive and elusive, and the lush vegetation of late
summer provides them with abundant hiding places. Nevertheless
it is remarkable that the hatchlings are so seldom seem, when
their probable abundance is taken into account.</p>

<p>Probably all of those captured had already made some growth
after hatching. By early November or the last week of October,
racers have almost or quite completed their season of activity, and
are at the hilltop ledges, preparing to hibernate, if they have not
already retired into dormancy. For 25 young of the year captured
in this period at the end of the growing season, measurements and
weights were as follows: snout-to-vent, 327 (273 to 418) millimeters;
tail 93 (72 to 114) millimeters; weight, 12.3 (7 to 19) grams.
In the ten-week period between hatching and hibernation these
young had already passed through their period of most rapid growth,
having added, on the average, more than 50 per cent to their original
lengths, and almost tripled in weight. In these young about to
enter their first hibernation, variation in size and weight is much
greater than in the hatchlings; some have fared much better than
others, and there are significant age differences. Within any one
year the time of hatching is spread over several weeks because of
differences in the time of laying, and differences in nest sites, with
variation in heat received, which promotes or delays the rate of
incubation. Year to year differences in the trend of weather increase
the dispersion as the incubation time is shortened in hot,
dry summers and lengthened in those that are relatively cool and
moist.</p>

<p>Though covering a wide size-range, the young of the year entering
hibernation are still a distinct size group, not yet overlapping
that of the next older group of young. Growth during the first year
of life is best shown by the individuals in <a href="#Table_12">Table 12</a>, all of which
were marked either before their first hibernation or soon after
emerging from it, and were recaptured either the following autumn,
or in spring soon after emerging from a second hibernation.</p>

<p>These records indicate that the young racers at the time of their
second hibernation have grown to a snout-vent length of well over
500 millimeters, but less than 700 millimeters, and a weight of
more than 40 grams but less than 100 grams. Other racers marked
in the first few weeks of life were recaptured after two or more
seasons of growth, and indicate the sizes that may be expected in
young adults from two to five years old, as shown in <a href="#Table_13">Table 13</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike young of the year, racers in their second autumn were
trapped in large numbers. By this time all were large enough to
be caught in the traps of quarter-inch wire mesh, and they were
the most abundant size group. Many that were marked at this
stage were recaptured after intervals of months or years, showing
the trend of growth. Some of these snakes in their second autumn
already had overtaken the more retarded third-year individuals.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
The two age classes cannot be separated with certainty. Selected
records of individuals that were almost certainly second-year young
at the time they were marked are presented in <a href="#Table_14">Table 14</a>.</p>

<p>From the records in <a href="#Table_14">Table 14</a> and many more like them, average
and extreme sizes for progressively older age groups were estimated.
Even racers that were already of adult size when they were
marked were tentatively identified with one or another age group,
and their records of subsequent growth were used. Most of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
records show that the females grow more rapidly than the males,
and are, on the average, larger at any given age.</p>

<p>Relatively few individual racers were recaptured after periods
of several years. Each of the eight listed in <a href="#Table_15">Table 15</a> is among those
that were captured in four or more different years, and their records
are significant in revealing the trend of growth after sexual maturity
has been attained. These snakes, one to three years old at the
time they were marked, show well the persistent but decreasing
growth, and the fluctuating weight that is characteristic of this and
other species.</p>

various ages. Growth is especially rapid in the first year, but continues, with
gradual slowing, throughout life. In hatchlings, the sexes are of approximately
equal size, but females grow to be markedly larger than males.</p>
</div>

<p>Some of the largest racers recorded had already reached unusually
large size when they were first captured, so there was no
opportunity to determine their ages. Several others, originally
captured as small- or medium-sized adults, subsequently grew to a
size approaching the maximum, and thus provided a basis for
estimating the ages of large individuals. The records of nine such
racers are listed in <a href="#Table_16">Table 16</a>.</p>

<p>A few adult racers recaptured, including different individuals of
small, medium, and large size, failed to make any measurable gain
in length over periods of months, or even over several years. Most
often the large individuals were those that failed to grow or made
only slight gains. Some of the snakes that failed to increase in
length suffered dramatic weight losses, perhaps as a result of injury,
disease, or parasitism. However, other individuals that failed
to gain appreciably in length did gain in weight. Doubtless both

<p>The behavior patterns that are associated with defense and
escape in snakes are widespread. The common racer is typical of
the more generalized snakes. Almost all elements of the racer's
behavior are found in snakes of other genera and perhaps, of other
families. The racer differs from these only in minor details of its
behavior, in the circumstances under which various behavioral
traits are elicited, and their relative importance. The common
racer is one of the swiftest of North American snakes, and it usually
depends upon speed to avoid enemies. Racers crossing roads may
detect approaching automobiles at a distance, and thereby may
be stimulated to accelerate their movements and so escape onto the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
shoulders rather than becoming traffic casualties as many individuals
of most other kinds of snakes do under the same circumstances.
The chances of such escape are of course much better on
dirt roads that are relatively narrow and have a rough surface permitting
efficient traction, than on wide smooth, paved highways.
The snakes are somewhat reluctant to venture onto open expanses
of pavement.</p>

<p>A racer suddenly startled by close approach of a human usually
flees at high speed. The first part of its course, up to 20 feet or
more, is marked by a violent lateral thrashing of the body and tail,
which may help the snake to gain speed, but which seem chiefly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
designed to draw attention of a potential attacker to the spot that
the snake is leaving. In any event, the mode of progression abruptly
changes to a swifter and much smoother travel, and the snake
may seem to vanish completely or as it glides rapidly away, its
course may be marked by the slowly waving tops of tall grass. The
trend of travel away from the site of disturbance is in an irregularly
zig-zag course. The method of crawling, with lateral undulations
of the body, supported against scattered pivot-points along the way,
tends to prevent the snake from moving more than a short distance
in a straight line.</p>

<p>In checking traps along hilltop rock ledges in October, I have
often flushed racers that had come to the ledges searching for
hibernation dens. In such an instance the startled racer would
usually dart away down the steep slope at unusually high speed,
and within a few seconds might have covered 100 feet or more,
progressing with a minimum of lateral undulations, and seeming
to flow or coast over the ground surface with scarcely any effort.
Although coursing downhill in this manner provided an effective
method of escape, racers startled at the ledges or on other sloping
ground sometimes followed a course parallel to the ledge, or even
turned uphill, with disastrous slowing. Often I have accomplished
capture by hand, by the strategy of running downhill to get below
the escaping snake, causing it to turn back up the slope, there to
be slowed to the extent that it could be overtaken.</p>

<p>A racer that has been flushed, and has disappeared after creating
a commotion by its violent thrashing, may, within a period of
minutes, return surreptitiously to the vicinity, gliding back slowly
and silently from the direction opposite that in which it departed. It
may climb into a tree or bush where, lying stretched on outer twigs
and concealed in dense foliage, it will sometimes permit close approach,
rather than reveal its presence by moving. If too much disturbed
however, such a snake will move away, higher, or to the
opposite side of the clump, with a slow and stealthy gliding motion
which is likely to escape detection. The sudden stops and abrupt
changes in direction make it difficult to follow the course of a climbing
racer, even though it is moving slowly. The tendency to climb
to escape danger seems to be especially strong in the western subspecies,
<i>C. c. mormon</i>. In my years of experience with the racers
in the chaparral belt of western Oregon and California, I found
that one of the most characteristic responses to danger was to climb
into a bush or low tree and seek concealment in the thick foliage.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
In most instances the snake was from one to eight feet above the
ground; usually it did not attempt to climb high in a tree even
when there was opportunity to do so. The racer's prowess as a
climber is limited. In thick brush where its weight is supported by
numerous stiff twigs simultaneously, it is at home and can travel
rapidly, but it cannot cling effectively to rough bark of a vertical
tree trunk as can the rat snakes (<i>Elaphe</i> sp.) and others that are
more specialized in their arboreal adaptations. Chaparral-type
shrubs such as <i>Ceanothus cuneatus</i> and <i>Arctostaphylos viscida</i> were
those in which western yellow-bellied racers were seen climbing
most frequently. Crab-apple (<i>Pyrus ioensis</i>) and haw (<i>Crataegus</i>
sp.) were the shrubs most frequently utilized by blue racers on
the Reservation. Carr (1950:80) noted that Florida racers were
much less given to tree-climbing than were those of more northern
regions. <i>C. c. stejnegerianus</i> of southern Texas is reputed to
have arboreal tendencies highly developed (Mulaik and Mulaik,
1942:14).</p>

<p>The racers kept in an outdoor enclosure in the summer of 1962
spent much of their time above the ground, climbing in several
walnut saplings. Usually in the warmer part of the day three or
four of the five racers in the pen were climbing. In the trees a
racer usually lay extended or in a loose coil among foliage in the
outer twigs, at a height of five to 12 feet. Such a snake might rest
for hours in almost the same position. Racers do not ordinarily
enter the water voluntarily, but they are swift and efficient swimmers
when the need arises. On one occasion a large female, seen
near the edge of the pond on the Reservation, and approached
from the landward side, took to the water without hesitation and
swam strongly to the opposite shore more than 100 feet away.
Other observers have recorded similar incidents.</p>

<p>A racer that is suddenly startled at close range may make no
attempt to escape, but instead may coil and perform slow writhing
movements, with the head pressed to the ground and concealed
beneath part of the body. Musk, exuding from the anus is spread
over the body surface as the movements continue. Only a small
percentage of the racers found free in their natural habitats reacted
in the manner described. In each such instance, the circumstances
were such that the racer was prevented from making its usual
rapid getaway, either because temperature was unusually low for
activity, or because the snake was away from suitable cover. After
removal from a live-trap, with handling, and especially clipping of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
scales, racers were much more likely to behave in this passively
defensive manner, which seemingly constitutes a second line of
defense in snakes which have been prevented from escaping&mdash;either
cornered, captured, or injured by a predator. The musk
is creamlike in color and consistency, and is secreted from sausage-shaped
glands in the base of the tail. Its odor is rather disagreeable,
but less so than that of musks of various other genera. Also,
it is less penetrating and lasting than many other musks. In handling
the racers removed from traps I attempted to avoid being
smeared with the musk by grasping the snake by the tail and neck
and keeping its body stretched out. While the snake was being
examined, and measured a droplet of musk would form at the anal
orifice and would begin to flow down the snake's body. To avoid
contact with the musk I would wipe away the droplet with a paper
towel or leaf, but the musk droplet might be replaced several times
within the few minutes that the snake was restrained.</p>

<p>A racer that is confronted with an object arousing its suspicion
or indicating possible danger, may move away slowly with a characteristic
"threat display." The forebody and neck are held rigid,
well off the ground, and slightly arched, with the neck flattened in
a vertical plane&mdash;causing this part of the snake to appear from
lateral view larger than it actually is. The tongue is protruded
frequently and waved slowly. A racer that has been disturbed and
is trying to gain shelter in a direction that brings it closer to the
danger usually will adopt this tense attitude, but a single threatening
movement will cause it to abandon its circumspect pose, and
panic in an attempt to reach the nearest shelter in the shortest possible
time.</p>

<p>A common response to an alarm is to vibrate the tail. The tail
being long and slender is vibrated much less rapidly than the short,
muscular organ of a rattlesnake, or even the medium-short tail of
a bull snake. The rapid twitching produces a characteristic sound
in dry vegetation. A racer that vibrates its tail is fully active and
aroused; the sound is heard as the snake pauses before it makes a
dash for shelter. At times the sound probably functions as a decoy
to distract the attention of potential predators, affording the racer
an opportunity to escape.</p>

<p>A racer that is cornered or captured usually puts up a spirited
struggle, striking vigorously and repeatedly at its tormentor. If
only cornered, it will make slashing strokes at the enemy, jerking
back to a coil from each stroke in a manner that causes the teeth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
to lacerate the enemy's skin in long scratches if the stroke finds its
target. The rapid recoil often causes teeth to be jerked from their
sockets and left embedded in the wound inflicted by the bite. On
many occasions in sustaining a bite from a racer I have received
such teeth which have remained undetected for a day or more until
soreness and festering led to their discovery and removal. A racer
that is grasped may deliver several bites within a few seconds,
chewing vigorously to imbed its teeth to the maximum at each bite.</p>

<p>If grasped by the tail and held clear of the ground, the racer
would swing its body with a rapid whirling and twisting motion,
which in a few seconds would twist off the end of the tail, unless
countermeasures were promptly taken. Many racers, especially the
larger and older ones, have parts of the tail missing, as a result of
such escapes, and perhaps also from freezing in hibernation or from
certain injuries and infections. If grasped by the body, the racer
struggles with a violent lateral thrashing to break the grip of its
captor, at the same time striking to bite and discharging musk,
urinary wastes and feces.</p>

<p>Many of the racers examined bore scars from wounds that were
probably inflicted by predators. A few had survived severe skeletal
injuries, involving deformation of the spinal column or extensive
tearing of muscle and connective tissue layers of the body wall,
altering the normal body shape. A more frequent type of injury
involved chiefly the integument, which had been ripped open by
the teeth, claws, or bills of adversaries, despite the fact that the
skin is remarkably tough and leathery. Patches of scar tissue with
scales in irregular sizes, shapes and patterns characterized such injuries.
The most frequently observed type of injury involved loss
of part of the tail. Usually only a small terminal part was missing,
but occasional stub-tailed individuals had lost as much as three-fourths
of the tail.</p>

<p>No consistent trend of difference between the sexes in incidence
of injuries to the tail was noticeable, but there was definite correlation
with age. In the entire sample from the Reservation and
Rockefeller Tract the percentages in each supposed age group
(actually size group) lacking part of the tail were as follows:
hatchlings, 2.9 per cent; one-year-olds, 9.5 per cent; two-year-olds,
15.8 per cent; three-year-olds, 14.3 per cent; four-year-olds, 15.7 per
cent; five-year-olds, 23.2 per cent; six-year-olds, 30.9 per cent; seven-year-olds,
28.9 per cent; those eight years old or older, 21.1 per
cent. The seeming reversal of trend in the older racers is difficult
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
to explain, but probably results from inadequate numbers in this
part of the sample.</p>

<p>Although the racer's most characteristic response to any disturbance
is to flee at high speed, certain individuals are inclined to behave
aggressively under exceptional circumstances. Records of such
aggressive behavior nearly all pertain to large individuals of the
northeastern black racer (<i>C. c. constrictor</i>) in the breeding season.
Cope (1900:794) wrote: "it is courageous and will sometimes attack,
moving forward with the head raised from 1 to 2 feet above
the ground." Ditmars (1944:13) wrote: "Occasional specimens in
the breeding season ... will actually attack ... glide toward
an intruder ... striking madly at one's feet or legs."
Woods (1944:257) quoted a 13-year-old amateur herpetologist,
Leon Gonthier, regarding the latter's encounter with an aggressive
black racer on May 7, 1944, as follows: "When I ran toward the
snake about 20 feet away, it turned and came for me. As I bent
over to catch it, the snake grabbed me by the shirt and hung on
... held it off with a stick. It jumped twice more at me and
came clear off the ground." Finneran (1948:124) describing the
species' habits in Connecticut, stated: "A farmer ... constantly
warned me away from Coon Ledge during the spring, saying
the snakes were breeding and would 'chase you.' This very
thing happened. In 1943 a blacksnake followed me for approximately
ten feet, and, in 1946, a male aggressively attacked me for
a period of three minutes. There was ample opportunity for escape."</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="Natural_Enemies" id="Natural_Enemies"></a><i>Natural Enemies</i></p>

<p>Little has been published concerning the natural enemies of the
common racer. The king snake (<i>Lampropeltis getulus</i>) is notorious
for ophiphagy, and doubtless preys upon the racer at times. Wright
and Bishop (1915:169) wrote of the king snake in Okefinokee
Swamp, in Georgia, that "all the smaller snakes suffer, and of the
larger species, the blacksnake [racer] and spreading adder are the
commonest prey." However, Clark (1949:252) examined 301
stomachs of king snakes of this species in Louisiana and found no
racers, although many other kinds of snakes were represented, and,
collectively, made up the greater part of the food.</p>

<p>A rat snake (<i>Elaphe obsoleta</i>) found in Leon County, Florida,
on June 10, 1924, had a racer in its stomach, according to the
Patuxent food habits file of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. A
California garter snake (<i>Thamnophis elegans terrestris</i>) was found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
to have a juvenal racer in its stomach (Fitch, 1940:96). A large
alligator lizard (<i>Gerrhonotus multicarinatus</i>) was found swallowing
a small racer that had been confined with it in a bag (Fitch,
1935:12).</p>

<p>A few records of predation on blue racers by other reptiles on
the Reservation and Rockefeller Tract were obtained. In 25 scats
of the prairie king snake (<i>Lampropeltis calligaster</i>), there were 29
vertebrate prey items of which one was a blue racer. On September
15, 1962, an adult male prairie king snake 49<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches in length was
found to have a 27-inch yearling racer in its stomach. In 254 scats
of the slender glass lizard (<i>Ophisaurus attenuatus</i>) vertebrate remains
were rare, but there were scales and bones of one hatchling
blue racer. Among 21 vertebrate prey items in 14 scats of the
timber rattlesnake (<i>Crotalus horridus</i>) there were remains of one
blue racer. Among 589 prey items of copperheads there were two
juvenal blue racers (Fitch, 1960:200). In contrast to these scarce
records of racers in the prey of other snakes, there were more
frequent records of the blue racer preying on its own young. The
1008 food items from 479 racer scats contained remains of 16 racers,
small young in most instances.</p>

<p>Raptorial birds are known to be important predators on snakes.
Breckenridge (1944:118) reported finding remains of a blue racer
in the pellet of a marsh hawk (<i>Circus cyaneus</i>). Many pellets of
the marsh hawk collected on the Reservation were all found during
the colder half of the year, and they contained no remains of
reptiles. The same seasonal restrictions applied to the many pellets
of four species of owls that were collected, and these also lacked
remains of reptiles. One of the predators whose food habits have
been most thoroughly investigated on the area is the red-tailed
hawk (<i>Buteo jamaicensis</i>). Over the period 1955 through 1962,
1131 pellets of these hawks were collected, many from the Reservation,
but more from localities scattered throughout the eastern one-fourth
of Kansas. The pellets were those of nestlings and fledglings,
nearly all collected from beneath the nests, in late May, June, or
early July. Some 49 different nests were represented, and remains
of 43 blue racers were found. In one nest which yielded a total
of 191 food items, racer remains occurred 13 times, but no other
nest yielded records of more than three racers, and some other
species of reptiles, notably the black rat snake (<i>Elaphe obsoleta</i>)
comprised much more important components of the food. Since
only one meal in 26 contained remains of racers, it seems that a red-tailed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
hawk would destroy only a few racers in the course of a year
on its territory of perhaps half a square mile, and that its predation
would not be a major factor in the racer's ecology.</p>

<p>That the red-tailed hawk is a natural enemy to be reckoned with
throughout the racer's extensive range was demonstrated by the
analysis of contents of 116 stomachs from localities well scattered
over the United States and Canada. Among the 152 vertebrate
prey items represented there were three racers: a juvenile <i>C. c.
constrictor</i> from Stag Lake, New Jersey, October 16, 1927; a <i>C. c.
mormon</i> from Weiser, Idaho, April 11, 1930, and a <i>C. c. stejnegerianus</i>
from San Roman, Cameron County, Texas, in the spring
of 1938. Because of the widely scattered geographical origin of
these stomachs, a remarkably large number of species of prey were
represented, and no one species predominated. Small mammals of
the genera <i>Sylvilagus</i>, <i>Spermophilus</i>, and <i>Thomomys</i> comprised the
most important component of the food; the only other reptile so
well represented as the racer was the common garter snake
(<i>Thamnophis sirtalis</i>) which likewise had three occurrences.</p>

<p>In June and July, 1954, a nest of broad-winged hawks (<i>Buteo
platypterus</i>) on the Reservation yielded 71 prey items of which
seven were blue racers. At least 19 species of prey were represented,
although specific determinations were not possible in some
instances. The prairie vole with eight records was the most frequent
prey, and the racer and cardinal (nestlings) each had seven, while
all other species were represented by fewer occurrences. Six of
the racers were first-year young but the remaining one was thought
to be an undersized second-year individual. Although an adult
racer, especially a large one, would probably be an adversary too
powerful to be killed and eaten by a broad-winged hawk, this hawk
is perhaps one of the more important natural enemies of the first-year
young in the eastern United States.</p>

<p>Further records of predation on racers by raptors were obtained
from the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service files through the kindness
of Dr. Wm. H. Stickel. There were three records of such
predation by red-shouldered hawks (<i>Buteo lineatus</i>) from Lunenberg,
Massachusetts, May 1, 1896; Portland, Maine, March 16,
1906; and 65 miles northeast of Sarasota, Florida, June 10, 1918.
There were two records of predation by broad-winged hawks
from Catlettsburg, Kentucky, July 26, 1910, and Portland, Connecticut,
May 18, 1912. There were four records of predation by
marsh hawks on racers&mdash;Peck's Island, Maine, September 18, 1903;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
Edgartown, Massachusetts, April 12, 1912; West [Tisbury?], Massachusetts,
July 31, 1912; and Okanagan Landing, British Columbia,
June 5, 1918. A sparrow hawk (<i>Falco sparverius</i>) from De Ranch,
Wyoming, May 27, 1910, had eaten a racer, as had a barn owl
(<i>Tyto alba</i>), from Franklin County, Kansas, November 16, 1922,
and a crow (<i>Corvus brachyrhynchos</i>, nestling) from Onaga, Kansas,
May 16, 1914.</p>

<p>Perhaps certain mammalian predators are even more important
natural enemies than are raptorial birds, but records of predation
on racers by mammals are few. Substantial samples of scats of
opossums and coyotes from the Reservation have contained no remains
of racers. The Fish and Wildlife Service files include a record
of an opossum from Adrian, Michigan, on April 26, 1934, that had
racer remains in its stomach. No racers were specifically recorded
from a collection of 820 scats and 22 stomachs of raccoons (<i>Procyon
lotor</i>) from Douglas County, Kansas, reported upon by Stains
(1956:43), but occurrences of unidentified snake may have pertained
in part to the racer. Skunks are probably more important
natural enemies, but food habits data from the Reservation are
lacking for the two kinds of skunks occurring there. Crabb (1941:356)
in a study of the food habits of the spotted skunk (<i>Spilogale
putorius</i>) in southeastern Iowa, did not report any reptiles among
the many kinds of prey found in scats. Several times in many years
of residence near Medford, Jackson County, Oregon, I saw remains
of racers which appeared to be victims of striped skunks (<i>Mephitis
mephitis</i>). Tracks and other sign of the skunks were often noticed
along a little-used road on a hillside, passing between a pasture and
a hay field, with an oak grove, high weeds, and brush, bordering
the road. The racers sometimes found as victims along this road
were small- or medium-sized individuals. In every instance the
predator had begun eating on the tail end of the snake, and later
had abandoned the remains leaving the head and part of the forebody
still intact. Predation had occurred at night. Skunks foraging
mostly in twilight or darkness, probably find racers inactive beneath
flat rocks or in shallow burrows. The skunks would be too slow and
clumsy to catch the snakes in the open when they were fully active.</p>

<p>The funnel traps used for catching the racers also caught many
other kinds of animals. Often a racer and another kind of snake
were caught together, but, ordinarily, in these instances no damage
to either resulted, although racers, copperheads, king snakes, and
garter snakes are all known to eat each other's young. At times,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
large predatory ground beetles (<i>Calosoma scrutator</i> and <i>Pasimachus</i>
sp.) were so abundant that a dozen or more were caught together
in a trap, and several times such groups attacked and killed and
partly ate young racers caught in the same traps. White-footed
mice (<i>Peromyscus leucopus</i>), deer mice (<i>P. maniculatus</i>), harvest
mice (<i>Reithrodontomys megalotis</i>), short-tailed shrews (<i>Blarina
brevicauda</i>), and least shrews (<i>Cryptotis parva</i>) all were caught
rather frequently in the traps, and each, on one or more occasions,
gnawed and killed or severely injured a racer trapped with it. The
attacks probably were motivated by hunger in all instances, the
snake in some instances failing to defend itself or escape because of
low temperature. Occasionally such encounters might occur even
under natural conditions, the mouse or shrew finding and attacking
the snake while the latter was torpid and helpless in its hibernaculum
or in a more superficial temporary shelter.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="Disease" id="Disease"></a><i>Disease</i></p>

<p>Relatively few of the racers examined showed signs of disease.
The most common type of affliction was an infection of the skin
causing cankerlike sores, chiefly on the ventral plates, sometimes on
the head or tail. These were seen most often in snakes recently
emerged from hibernation, but persisted later in the season in years
of exceptionally wet weather. Some of the racers most severely
afflicted appeared to be in debilitated condition. The causal
organism was not determined, nor was it definitely determined
whether this type of disease causes mortality.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="Parasites" id="Parasites"></a><i>Parasites</i></p>

<p>The ectoparasites of the racer are chiefly chiggers, the parasitic
larvae of mites. Loomis (1956) in his study of the chigger mites
of Kansas examined many of the racers captured in the early years
of my field work. He checked a total of 130 racers, mostly from
the Reservation, and found four different species of chiggers, all of
the genus <i>Trombicula</i>: <i>T. alfreddugèsi</i>, <i>T. lipovskyana</i>, <i>T. kansensis</i>
and <i>T. sylvilagi</i>. The common pest chigger, <i>T. alfreddugèsi</i>, parasitizes
most of the species of reptiles, birds, and mammals occurring
in Kansas, and it was by far the most common kind on the racers.
The numbers per racer in different months were as follows: June,
81; July, 285; August, 432; September, 123; October, 15. Many of
the racers were collected in the relatively cool and moist summers
of 1950 and 1951. In a year of typical weather, heaviest infestations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
occur in early summer, June or the first half of July, and the
numbers taper off rapidly in the hot but often dry weather of late
July, August, September, and October. In hot, humid weather of
early summer a racer may have several hundred chiggers attached
to it, filling most of the areas of exposed skin between the scales.
The chiggers are conspicuous because of their bright orange color.
Like <i>T. alfreddugèsi</i>, <i>T. lipovskyana</i> was also found in large numbers
on racers and is found on many kinds of hosts. Loomis (<i>op.
cit.</i>:1281) recorded it from one kind of frog, one kind of toad, one
kind of turtle, two of lizards, six of snakes, 19 of birds, and nine of
mammals from eastern Kansas. Five larvae of <i>T. sylvilagi</i> were
recorded from a racer captured in October. That kind of chigger is
primarily a parasite of small mammals, and perhaps cannot develop
successfully when it attaches to a snake. Unlike most other kinds
of chiggers, this species is most in evidence in autumn and winter.
A single larva of <i>T. kansensis</i> was found on a racer in October. This
relatively rare kind of chigger has been found on several kinds of
snakes and small mammals (including pocket gophers) and is
known from hot and dry rocky places. Even the racers that were
heavily loaded with chiggers showed no obvious ill effects, but the
chiggers are potentially vectors of various diseases.</p>

<p>Of the many endoparasites found in racers, the lung fluke,
<i>Neorenifer lateriporus</i> was the only one identified and frequently
observed in my study (Stewart, 1959). This is a digenetic trematode
of the subfamily Reniferinae. The racer is its specific host.
The life history is still unknown, but in other members of the subfamily,
all of which parasitize snakes, an aquatic snail and a frog
are required as hosts at different stages of the life cycle. Presumably
<i>N. lateriporus</i> has similar requirements. The two common
local water snails, <i>Heliosoma trivolvis</i> and <i>Physa anatina</i>, are both
potential hosts. By far the most probable frog host is the leopard
frog. In wet weather of July the recently metamorphosed leopard
frogs leave the water and disperse to all habitats, probably carrying
with them the parasites acquired in the tadpole stage. The
racers in turn probably acquire their flukes by eating the young
frogs in summer. In any case, the adult racers are nearly all
parasitized, but the flukes have not been found in those racers that
were less than one year old. During their first few months, the
racers are too small to swallow leopard frogs, even the young. The
flukes have been seen in the live racers mostly in May, when most
adults are infested with the flukes. Seemingly at this season the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
flukes migrate forward into the mouth of the host. Probably this
is the time when the flukes breed and lay eggs; if so, the eggs would
pass through the digestive tract of the snake and escape with its
feces. The latter are usually left in terrestrial situations unfavorable
for the development of an aquatic stage, but perhaps some of
the eggs are washed into ponds by heavy summer rains. In late
summer and fall the flukes are not to be found in the mouths of
the live snakes.</p>

<p>Most complete records of the flukes present in racers were kept
in 1959. The following table shows the numbers of racers examined
and the percentage having flukes in that year.</p>

<p>Ortenburger (1928:182) recorded lung flukes (<i>Renifer ellipticus</i>)
from blue racers. In Maryland, McCauley (1945:76) also recorded
numerous lung flukes (<i>Pseudorenifer</i> sp.) in an immature racer
490 millimeters in total length. Parker (1941:34) recorded <i>Neorenifer
septicus</i> from racers collected at Reelfoot Lake, Tennessee,
Greensboro, Georgia, and Kissimmee, Florida; also he recorded <i>N.
georgianum</i> from racers collected at Reelfoot Lake. <i>N. septicus</i>
was recorded by the same author from the water moccasin (<i>Agkistrodon
piscivorus</i>) and <i>N. georgianum</i> was also recorded from the
king snake (<i>Lampropeltis getulus</i>).</p>

<p>Cloacal smears from the racers examined usually showed an
abundance of ciliate protozoans, either parasites or commensals,
and occasionally nematode worms. Harwood (1933:66) examined
two racers from the vicinity of Houston, Texas, and found four
kinds of helminths: <i>Kalicephalus agkistrodontis</i>, <i>K. rectiphilus</i>,
<i>Ophidascaris</i> sp., and <i>Polydelphis</i> sp. Each parasite was found in
only one of the two snakes. McCauley (<i>loc. cit.</i>) recorded nematodes
(<i>Physaloptera obtusissima</i>) from black racers in Maryland,
and Ortenburger (<i>loc. cit.</i>) recorded <i>Physaloptera</i> sp. from the blue
racer.</p>

<p class="caption3"><a name="Composition" id="Composition"></a><i>Composition</i></p>

<p>Since there is a brief annual breeding season, any local population
of racers consists of a series of discrete annual age groups. The
population reaches its annual maximum in early September, after
undergoing sudden increase by the addition of the annual crop of
hatchlings. Throughout the remainder of the year numbers of
racers undergo gradual reduction as a result of the many combined
mortality factors that affect them. This mortality is distributed
among all the age classes, but the heaviest losses, both percentage-wise
and in actual numbers, are sustained by the first-year young.
Being by far the most numerous group, these young suffer more
mortality than all the other age classes combined. Presumably much
of this mortality is concentrated in the early weeks of life, while
the young are still near their minimum size; the rate of loss is
gradually reduced as larger size is attained and some of the early
hazards are outgrown. In the adult age classes also, the larger and
older snakes live in greater security, and the rate of mortality is
higher in the smaller and younger snakes. Even before hatching,
the eggs are subject to heavy losses from predators, and probably
from drying, flooding, and other unfavorable climatic factors. Unfortunately
it was not possible to obtain definite figures on any of
these losses since the eggs were never found under natural conditions
and the hatchlings were seen only in relatively small numbers.</p>

<p>The records obtained from trapping racers in late spring and
summer in fields provided a somewhat different picture of the
population from the sample obtained along the ledges in autumn.
In the former sample there were 400 males to 257 females, but in
the latter sample there were 355 males to 379 females. I regard
the summer sex ratio as a distorted one, brought about by the
greater activity of the males in the breeding season. Racers are
caught most easily in May, and the fact that two or more males
often were trapped with the same female, while the reciprocal
combinations did not occur, demonstrates the increased activity of
the males in their search for mates at this season. In autumn there
is no sexual activity; both sexes probably are equally active in seeking
places to hibernate when they are trapped along the hilltop
outcrops. The ratio of 51.6 per cent females in my sample of 734
may indicate that in the males greater activity at other seasons results
in a somewhat higher mortality. This idea is borne out by
the fact that for the supposed two-, three- and four-year-olds combined,
females comprise 51.2 per cent, but they comprise 55.6 per
cent of those more than four years old and 61.3 per cent of those
more than five years old.</p>

in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California).
In the museum sample, collected by conventional methods,
the first-year young constitute a prominent and fairly distinct size
group, whereas in the sample of racers from the Reservation and
Rockefeller Tract, mostly caught in wire traps of quarter-inch mesh,
relatively few young were secured. It is demonstrated that hatchlings
are approximately the same length in both populations, but
<i>flaviventris</i> grows much longer, and that the differences in length

<p>Figures are completely lacking to show the relative numbers of
juveniles, until, already approaching adult size, the young are about
to enter their second hibernation. My combined fall samples include
303 of these latter young, as against 142 racers about to enter
their third hibernation. Thus, after having nearly attained adult
size, these adolescent snakes sustained a loss of 53 per cent in a
year. Losses must occur at an even more rapid rate in the younger
and smaller snakes. It may be speculated that of the approximately
300 eggs produced by a population of 100 adult racers, 150 are lost
before or during the period of incubation which lasts nearly two
months. Of the 150 hatchlings emerging in early September, at
least one-third probably are eliminated by the following breeding
season in late May, leaving 100. The 100 survivors at this stage
are still small juveniles, but by autumn they have attained adolescent
size. By this time, if they had undergone a further reduction
by 53 per cent, only 47 would remain&mdash;approximately the number
to be expected if the population were stable from year to year.</p>

<p>A notable difference between the fall sample and the spring
sample that I obtained was the higher proportion of large and old
racers in the former sample. This difference can be attributed to
the year-to-year changes in the population during the 14 consecutive
years spanned by my field work. The fall sample of 734 racers
represented the combined catch of the years 1949 through 1962,
rather evenly distributed, but the spring sample included few snakes
from the years 1949 through 1957; most were from the years 1958
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
through 1961. In 1949 when the study was begun, the Reservation
was being protected for the first time, and formerly overgrazed
pastures or cultivated fields were acquiring a rank growth of grass
and weedy vegetation, and thus becoming favorable habitat. The
abundant new habitat promoted rapid increase in the population of
racers until the newly available areas were filled to their "carrying
capacity." <a href="#Table_21">Table 21</a> shows the changing trends of the different age
groups. Although the separate annual samples are perhaps too
small to show the composition of the population accurately, it is
significant that in the fall of 1949 an unusually high proportion of
the racers caught were one-year-olds, hatched in September, 1948.</p>

<p><a href="#Table_20">Table 20</a> shows that in a typical group of 100 subadult and adult
racers (second year and older) only a little more than one-fourth
are productive females. The largest females, six years old and
older, making up less than ten per cent of the adult population,
contribute nearly half the total complement of eggs.</p>

<p>The calculated number of eggs pertains to a stage before oviposition,
and subsequent losses through resorption under unfavorable
conditions, through inviability of embryos and through deaths
of some of the gravid females, are to be expected. In the weeks
of incubation further losses are sustained. Although these losses
cannot be measured, they must be severe as on numerous occasions
scattered and torn eggshells representing entire clutches dug out
and destroyed by predators, have been found. Probably other
clutches are destroyed underground by such predators as moles and
egg-eating snakes, and still others by insects. Tinkle (1959:195)
wrote that in a clutch of 15 eggs found under a board, four were
parasitized and had small perforations. Molds destroy a high percentage
of all reptilian eggs that are incubated artificially and doubtless
destroy many under natural conditions also. Excessive heat
or moisture, or desiccation, resulting either from climatic extremes
or from poor choice of a nest site by the female, would cause
further loss. In four different years, Blair (1960:108) found that
losses of eggs between laying and hatching in the Texas spiny
lizard (<i>Sceloporus olivaceus</i>) ranged from 69 per cent to 86 per
cent; no other comparable study of the extent of egg losses in a
species of reptile is known to me. The racer is somewhat less
prolific than the spiny lizard, and potentially longer lived; the
racer's eggs are larger and thicker-shelled, and they are deposited
in deeper burrows. It might be expected that losses during incubation
would be somewhat less in the racer than in the spiny lizard.</p>

<p>Although figures for the youngest age groups&mdash;one-year-olds
and hatchlings&mdash;are missing, approximations of them may be furnished
by extrapolation, from the information available regarding
the productivity of the population. Some factors involved in productivity
are that the sex ratio deviates from parity, slightly in
favor of the females in the adolescents but more markedly in favor
of the females among the older age groups; that some adult females
apparently fail to produce eggs in the breeding season, but the
percentage decreases in the older snakes; and that number of eggs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
per clutch increases in proportion to the size and age of the female
producing them. Too few figures are available concerning most
of these factors to indicate more than the trends; nevertheless the
available figures have been used in <a href="#Table_20">Table 20</a> in an attempt to estimate
the productivity of a hypothetical population.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a name="Numbers" id="Numbers"></a><i>Numbers</i></p>

<p>Conant (1938:178, Pl. 7) published a photograph of 106 blue
racers killed in February, 1932, by farmers near Bellville, Ohio,
and Pope (1944:173) mentioned that scores of blue racers aggregated
in October around an oak-covered dune near Chicago.
In both these instances large hibernating aggregations were involved,
and the areas represented by them are unknown; nothing
has been recorded regarding population densities.</p>

<p>The records obtained through my fall trapping, along hilltop rock
outcrops, yielded no information concerning population densities,
but those obtained in fields in summer did provide significant information
in this regard. Even after years of trapping on the same
area, the catch still consisted largely of new individuals; the method
was not sufficiently effective to catch all racers present at any one
time, and the total catch for a season therefore provided only a
crude index of the minimum number present.</p>

<p>The summer trapping was carried on in three separate areas.
One of these was the area of bottomland pastures and formerly
cultivated fields where the Reservation headquarters are located,
a block of 39 acres bounded on three sides by woodland, and on
the fourth by cultivated farm land. Effective trapping in this area
was carried on through the years 1955 to 1961 inclusive. A second
area, of 48 acres, was one of upland fields, mostly covered with re-established
prairie grasses, in the northeastern part of the Reservation.
A third area, of 137 acres, also upland, was that of the Rockefeller
Tract, cultivated through 1956 and sown to prairie grasses
the following year, and the adjacent northwestern hilltop portion
of the Reservation. Effective trapping on these two latter areas was
carried on in 1958 through 1962.</p>

<p>For the seven years of trapping in the House Field area, the
catch was as follows: 30, 33, 38, 38, 34, 24, and 20. In four years
of trapping, the northeast field area yielded 42, 28, 37, 59, and 19
blue racers, and the Rockefeller Tract yielded 52, 67, 67, 126, and
106. The actual catch was hence less than one per acre in nearly
all instances, but the year-to-year differences in catch are believed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
to be caused chiefly by differences in numbers of traps used and in
trapping effort, rather than by changes in the numbers of racers
present.</p>

<p>Best index to the number of racers actually present is provided by
the number of recaptures, and their ratio to first captures. The
population of course, undergoes alteration from year to year, with
many racers eliminated and replaced by others.</p>

<p>In 1955, 26 racers were caught in the May-June-July period, in
the headquarters field area. In the August-September-October
period of the same year five racers were caught of which only one
was a member of the original 26. The five-to-one ratio indicates
that the original 26 may have represented an actual population of
130, but of course the single recapture is much too small a sample
to provide a reliable ratio. Some of the racers caught in May were
recaptured in June, others in July, and still others not until late summer
or early autumn. Somewhat different estimates can be obtained
for the population depending on how the season's records are
divided. For instance, in the headquarters field area in May 1955,
eleven racers were caught; in the remainder of the season 20 were
caught, of which two were members of the original group of eleven.
The 20 to 2 ratio indicates that the 11 caught in May represented
an actual population of 110. In the period May-June, 18 racers
were caught, and in July-August-September-October, 15 were
caught, including four of the original 18, hence indicating a population
of 67. Although obviously the population underwent some
change during the course of the season, the three sets of census
figures apply essentially to the same population, and the divergence
in them illustrates the <a name="small_error" id="small_error"></a>wide range of error arising from insufficiently
small samples.</p>

<p>Common sources of error in the censusing of natural populations
of animals by the capture-recapture method ("Lincoln Index" or
"Petersen Index") arise from the fact that the composition of a local
population often changes between two sampling periods, or even
within them. Some of the animals marked may move elsewhere,
to be replaced by unmarked immigrants, or they may die and be
replaced by unmarked maturing young. First-year racers that could
pass through the quarter-inch mesh of the traps in spring and early
summer became too large to escape in this way in the latter half of
the summer, but these young were excluded from the census computations.
There was doubtless some shifting of marked individuals
away from the study areas and shifting of new individuals onto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
these areas in the periods of weeks between successive samplings.
Jackson (1939) has explained a method of correcting census computations
based on capture-recapture ratios when there is a consistent
trend of diminishing recaptures with increase in elapsed time.
However, in my records no such trend is discernible; furthermore it
has been demonstrated that individual racers tend to stay within the
same home range area throughout most of their season of activity.
Therefore, I conclude that shifts of individuals away from the study
areas or into them, in the intervals between samplings constitute
only a minor source of error.</p>

<p>A combination of the figures from the three samples listed above
provides an intermediate "smoothed" figure that can be accepted
with somewhat more confidence than any one of the separate
censuses because it is based on more records. The combined ratios
indicate a total of 105 racers in the headquarters field area. The
figures obtained in the different sampling periods, and the census
figures derived from their ratios are shown in tables 22 and 23.
Differences from year-to-year in the census figures for any one area
show no consistent trends and their variation is similar to that shown
in different samples for the same season. Probably populations
were fairly stable throughout the periods involved. If such
stability is assumed, the samples from different years may be
combined, and the composite figures derived from them may be
accepted with more confidence. For the headquarters field area,
for instance, 419 records of racers were gathered in all the preliminary
sampling periods of the seven seasons involved; the records
totalled 263 for all the secondary sampling periods, with 70
recaptures in secondary periods of the snakes recorded in the corresponding
preliminary periods. A population of 75 racers is indicated&mdash;1.9
per acre. Corresponding figures for the northeast field
area are: preliminary samples 453, secondary samples 163, recaptures
39, calculated number 135 (2.82 per acre). For the
Rockefeller Tract the figures are as follows: Preliminary samples
807, secondary samples 476, recaptures 126, the ratio indicating a
population of 153, or 1.11 per acre.</p>

<p>These figures represent the number of adults present in early
summer when the population is near its annual low point. The
first-year young, excluded from this census because they cannot be
caught in representative numbers, perhaps approximate the number
of adults, in May, so the figures obtained would need to be approximately
doubled to be representative of the entire population.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
By late summer the adults, and especially the yearlings, have undergone
substantial reduction in numbers, but in late August and early
September the hatching of a new crop of young increases the population
to its annual maximum. The maximum numbers probably
are about three times those obtained by censusing adults in early
summer. The peak population of late summer or early autumn is
estimated to consist of hatchlings, comprising somewhere near 50
per cent; adults, comprising a little more than 25 per cent; and
yearlings comprising a little less than 25 per cent.</p>

acre probably are typical of the better types of habitat in the
region of my study. The upland field area estimated to have 2.82
racers per acre was better habitat than the other two study areas.
Prior to 1948 it had been cultivated and severely eroded. In 1949
most of it was sown to seeds of prairie grasses, and by 1958 different
parts of it were dominated by different species of native
perennial tall grasses interspersed with areas that supported a weedy
type of vegetation, and other areas that supported dense thickets
of sumac, dogwood, elm saplings, or other woody plants. The
abundance and diversity of dense cover and of small animals made
this area especially favorable habitat for the racer.</p>

<p>Some local areas probably support higher populations of racers
than do areas where censuses were made, but under modern conditions,
situations that offer near optimum habitat are not likely to
be extensive or to persist long. On land that is capable of producing
a good crop of vegetation, the crop is usually harvested either
by grazing of livestock or by using the land for cultivation, with
the result that the racers are, at least in some seasons, forced into
marginal situations. More than 50 years ago in Missouri, Hurter
(1911:170) wrote that the racer "was quite common 20 years ago
in pastures, meadows and fields but as cultivation has advanced it
is becoming quite rare." In 1962 the widespread and adaptable
blue racer is still common in many parts of its range, including Missouri,
but in most places its population densities probably are lower
than formerly.</p>

<p>Reduction since 1911 has probably been far more drastic than
the reduction that had occurred up to that time. Schmidt and
Necker (1935:69), writing of the racer in the Chicago region, noted
"the snakes which raise their heads and face mowing machinery
tend to be exterminated in agricultural areas." They stated that in
the Chicago region the racer had been exterminated by the advance
of agriculture except in two extensive sand dune areas. In July
1962, Mr. V. B. Howell, a progressive farmer of the Great Bend
area in central Kansas, told me that the kinds of snakes inhabiting
cultivated land&mdash;blue racer, bull snakes, prairie king snakes, hog-nosed
snakes, and others&mdash;had undergone great reduction in numbers
during the period of his farming. He estimated that in a forty-year
period the numbers had declined to perhaps five per cent of
their level in the area most familiar to him, centering at his farm 11
miles northwest of Great Bend, Barton County. In accounting for
this change in population density Howell pointed out the relative
destructiveness to small animals of modern farm machinery as contrasted
with horse-drawn equipment or that used with tractors of
earlier models. Modern tractors move forward so rapidly that there
is little opportunity for snakes or other small animals to avoid them,
and the plows and disks cut wide swaths penetrating more deeply
into the soil than did older types. On July 10, 1962, in searching
the furrows of a freshly plowed small field on the Harold Brune
farm, for turned-up nests of the snakes, I found two adult blue
racers that had been struck and killed by the plow, possibly while
they were underground. In fields that are plowed or cultivated
between the times of egg-laying and hatching, the eggs are destroyed.
Because of its rapid movements and alertness, the racer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
is more likely to escape farm machines than are most other kinds
of snakes. Nevertheless, it is vulnerable and survives in cultivated
areas only when they are interspersed with pastures, woodlots, or
streamside thickets where at least part of the population may find
refuge.</p>




<p class="caption2"><a name="Summary" id="Summary"></a>Summary</p>


<p>Field study of the blue racer was carried on in several localities
in Kansas, but chiefly at the University of Kansas Natural History
Reservation (the northeasternmost section of land in Douglas
County), and the adjacent 160-acre Rockefeller Experimental Tract
in Jefferson County. By October 26, 1962, after 14 years of field
work, a total of 1423 racers had been captured some 2197 times.</p>

<p>The locale of the present study was near the geographic center
of the blue racer's range. The range, chiefly in the Mississippi
Valley and Great Plains region, is centrally situated with respect to
the other seven subspecies. An extensive but scattered literature
concerning the ecology of the species as a whole, and its several
geographic races, has been reviewed and utilized for comparison
with my own field data.</p>

<p>Blue racers were caught in wire funnel traps set in prairie and
pastureland habitat in summer, and along hilltop limestone outcrops
in woodland in autumn. The autumn trapping along rock
outcrops was carried on each year from 1949 to 1962, but effective
summer trapping was carried on only in the last six years of the
study. Each racer caught was individually and permanently
marked by scale clipping. More than half were caught only once,
but many were recorded repeatedly, with a maximum of 16 captures.</p>

<p>The racer occurs throughout most of the United States, and its
populations are subject to much geographic variation. The snakes
are largest in the northeastern part of the range, with clines of decreasing
size toward the southeastern, southern and western parts
of the United States. There are somewhat parallel trends in coloration;
the black racer of the northeastern states grades into paler,
gray or light brown subspecies in southern Florida, Texas, and the
far western states. Accompanying these changes in color and size
are minor morphological changes and major ecological changes.
The black racers of the eastern states often inhabit forest or forest-edge
habitats while the paler and smaller snakes of more southern
or western areas typically inhabit scrub, chaparral, or prairie. The
large, dark-colored racers of the eastern and northeastern states
are especially inclined to attack larger prey including small vertebrates,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
even weasels, rabbits, and chipmunks, whereas the smaller
and paler racers of more southern and more western areas take a
higher proportion of insects and rarely attack vertebrates other than
small reptiles.</p>

<p>On the area where field work was carried on in northeastern Kansas,
tall-grass prairie habitat is preferred, but fields of grain or
alfalfa, grazed pasture, brush, woodland edge, groves or open woodland,
and weedy fields are all utilized to some extent. The racer
is strictly diurnal and largely terrestrial but it may climb through
bushes or small trees in foraging or escaping.</p>

<p>The blue racer is a typical colubrine snake of slender build, with
large eyes, and vision plays an important role in finding prey and
detecting enemies. In the adult blue racer the dorsal color is variable,
pale brown or gray, bluish, greenish or slaty. In the hatchling,
however, there is a distinct pattern of a type widespread among
colubrines and also among snakes of other groups&mdash;a series of
middorsal blotches on an olive ground color, with alternating rows
of smaller spots on each side. The ventral surface is pale, with dark
speckling. The pattern is sharply defined on the anterior part of
the body, but markings become progressively more obscure posteriorly
and are scarcely discernible on the tail.</p>

<p>The juvenal pattern fades gradually as growth proceeds, and
there is much individual variation in the rate of its loss. Some
racers still retain the juvenal pattern faintly discernible after attainment
of sexual maturity. There are also striking ontogenetic
changes in the proportions of the head, body and tail. The diameter
of the eye is approximately one per cent of the snout-vent length
in hatchlings, but is only a little more than half that relative size in
the largest adults. In the course of allometric growth other parts
of the head also enlarge less rapidly than the body, but more
rapidly than the eye. In hatchlings there is a slight average difference
between the sexes in relative tail length, with males' tails
the longer. Relative tail length increases slightly in both sexes up
to the time of sexual maturity, and then decreases slightly with advancing
age.</p>

<p>Racers in northeastern Kansas spend nearly half the year in hibernation,
with average recorded emergence date April 16, and average
date of retirement into hibernation November 8. Hibernacula are
usually in crevices in hilltop limestone outcrops with south exposures.
Winter temperatures within the hibernacula are usually
well within the range 0 degrees to 10 degrees Centigrade. Spring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
emergence has been recorded at an air temperature of only 12.5
degrees Centigrade. Racers bask in sunshine frequently even in
warm weather, and the temperature preferendum is several degrees
higher than in most other kinds of snakes. Bodily temperatures obtained
from blue racers that were fully active, either under natural
conditions or in a large outdoor enclosure, were concentrated in the
neighborhood of 34 and 35 degrees Centigrade. For short periods
racers can survive temperatures up to 45 degrees without damage,
but more prolonged exposure to temperatures of slightly less than
40 degrees can be fatal. In hibernation, racers can withstand
temperatures slightly below freezing, but they cannot survive being
frozen solid.</p>

<p>Blue racers tend to limit their activities to familiar areas or home
ranges; some individuals may live out their entire lives within the
same home range, but others shift from time to time. Average
home ranges of approximately 26 acres for males and 24 acres for
females were calculated. The racers' preference for hibernacula
in a habitat different from that to which summer activities are confined
necessitates spring and fall migrations between the limestone
outcrops where hibernation occurs and the grasslands where the
snakes stay in summer. The average spring or fall migration is
approximately a quarter of a mile, but an individual racer does not
consistently return to the same hibernaculum. Many racers were
recorded to have made movements of 2000 to nearly 4000 feet, involving
shifts in home range, but some later shifted back to their
original areas. Some may have made even longer shifts but their
movements would not have been recorded since they would have
gotten beyond the limits of the study area.</p>

<p>Blue racers hunt by various methods, often by coursing through
dense vegetation in active search in which vision is of primary importance
in locating the prey. Almost any small animal that moves
nearby may be overtaken and caught with a sudden dash. From
analysis of scats and prey from stomachs, a total of 1357 food items
of more than 50 species was compiled. Favorite prey species were
the cricket (<i>Gryllus assimilis</i>), grasshoppers (<i>Arphia simplex</i>, <i>Melanoplus
femur-rubrum</i>, <i>M. bivittatus</i>, <i>M. differentialis</i>), camel
crickets (<i>Ceuthophilus</i> sp.), katydid (<i>Neoconocephalus robustus</i>),
vole (<i>Microtus ochrogaster</i>), white-footed mouse (<i>Peromyscus</i> sp.),
racerunner, (<i>Cnemidophorus sexlineatus</i>), and leopard frog (<i>Rana
pipiens</i>). The insects taken greatly outnumbered the vertebrates,
but the vertebrates made up most of the actual bulk of prey eaten.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
Crickets, grasshoppers, and katydids comprised most of the insect
prey. Beetles, moths and cicadas were rarely taken. Vertebrate
prey included miscellaneous small snakes (some of them juvenal
racers), mammals, and birds. Seasonal change in the composition
of the food is slight, but vertebrates figure more prominently in
early summer, and insects comprise increasing percentages later in
the season. Composition of the food differs according to size of
the snake; gryllid and ceuthophilid crickets are best represented in
the food of juveniles whereas small mammals, and grasshoppers of
the genus <i>Melanoplus</i> are best represented in the food of large
adults.</p>

<p>The breeding season is mainly in May. Mating is promiscuous
and two or more males may court the same female simultaneously.
A courting male lies on or alongside a receptive female, with
spasmodic rippling abdominal movements, and with his vent adpressed
to hers. At intervals in the courtship period the female
moves swiftly for a few feet or a few yards shifting to a new spot,
and during her activity the male strives to maintain contact with
her. From time to time the male leaves the female briefly and
courses rapidly around her in a devious route. Courtship is consummated
when the female raises her tail in acceptance of the male
and intromission is effected. During coitus, which lasts for periods
of minutes, the female moves forward slowly, dragging the passive
male, tail-first behind her.</p>

<p>Ovulation normally is in late May. Eggs from 29 to 39 millimeters
in length and 14 to 21 millimeters in breadth are laid, from
mid-June to early August, usually in tunnels of fossorial mammals
such as voles or moles, at depths of five to 12 inches. Clutches of
the blue racer average 11.8 eggs but the number is correlated with
age and size of females; two-year-olds average only 9.2 eggs,
whereas those females that are six years old or more average 15.7
eggs. Also, there is geographic variation in size of clutch, from
only 5.8 eggs in <i>C. c. mormon</i> of the West Coast to 16.8 eggs in
<i>C. c. constrictor</i> of the northeastern states. In each breeding season
some females of adult size do not produce clutches. Only about
13 per cent of the two-year-olds in a small sample were fecund, but
the ratio increased to 80 per cent in old adults. Incubation averages
51 (43 to 63) days.</p>

<p>Hatchlings usually make several longitudinal slits in the eggshell
with the egg tooth before emerging, and often require a day
or more to emerge after the first slit is made. Hatchlings average
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
10<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inches and 4.16 grams. By late October when these young are
ready to enter hibernation, they have grown to 16<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inches and 12.3
grams. Typical October lengths (overall) in inches for males and
females, respectively, after successive seasons of growth, are as
follows: yearlings, 27<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> and 29; two-year-olds, 34<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> and 37<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>; three-year-olds,
37<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> and 41<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>; four-year-olds, 40 and 44<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>; five-year-olds,
41<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> and 46<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>; six-year-olds, 42<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> and 48<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>; seven-year-olds, 43<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> and
50; eight-year-olds, 44 and 51<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<p>Judging from trends in the small samples available, sex ratio in
hatchlings is approximately 1:1. In the summer trapping of blue
racers, males are caught in larger numbers than females, but
seemingly this is because of their greater activity. In fall along
the limestone outcrops where the racers hibernate females were
caught in slightly greater numbers than males among the young
adults, and made up a little more than 60 per cent of the old adults.
Presumably the males are eliminated more rapidly, because of their
greater activity, their smaller size, or a combination of both factors.
The composition by age groups of the adult racers captured was
as follows: two-year-olds, 41.5 per cent; three-year-olds, 17.8 per
cent; four-year-olds, 12.6 per cent; five-year-olds, 9.5 per cent; six-year-olds,
6.1 per cent; seven-year-olds, 4.3 per cent; eight-year-olds,
2.7 per cent; nine-year-olds, 2.4 per cent; ten-year-olds, 1.2 per
cent; more than ten years old, 1.9 per cent.</p>

<p>Attempts to census blue racers on the study plots, from the
capture-recapture ratios, yielded highly variable figures for different
areas and even for the same area at different times. Variability
is believed to result mostly from the small sizes of the
samples, none of which is large enough to yield a census figure that
is statistically reliable. Combined samples yielded figures indicating
populations of one to three adults per acre in early summer
in areas of favorable habitat. To represent the entire population
in late summer&mdash;the time of its annual maximum&mdash;these figures
would need to be approximately tripled.</p>

<p>The blue racer depends mostly on speed to escape its enemies.
In escaping it often takes advantage of a downhill slope to increase
its speed. A racer startled at close range often sets out with a
violent thrashing that attracts attention to a given spot, then glides
away so silently and rapidly that its course is not detected. The
snake may circle back and approach the scene of disturbance slowly
and stealthily, from the direction opposite to that taken in departing.
Often a racer seeks concealment by climbing into a bush or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
tree, and occasionally escape is effected by swimming. A racer
that is caught or cornered usually makes a spirited defense by
striking and biting. An alternative reaction, seen most typically
when the snake is handicapped by injury or by low temperature,
is to coil with the head concealed, and, with writhing movements,
to smear the surface of the body with musk discharged from glands
in the base of the tail.</p>

<p>Many natural enemies prey upon the racer, but in the present
study the majority of records pertained to the red-tailed hawk. The
broad-winged hawk, marsh hawk, red-shouldered hawk, sparrow
hawk, and barn owl also are among the raptors that feed on this
kind of snake. Among mammals the striped skunk is the only
species definitely recorded to prey on the racer, feeding on the
eggs as well as upon the young and adults. The common king
snake, prairie king snake, timber rattlesnake, copperhead, and even
the slender glass lizard have been recorded to prey on the blue
racer, but probably all are of minor importance as natural enemies.
Shrews (<i>Blarina</i>, <i>Cryptotis</i>) and mice (<i>Peromyscus</i>, <i>Reithrodontomys</i>)
have sometimes killed and eaten racers confined in traps,
and under natural conditions they possibly prey upon snakes that
are immobilized when torpid from cold, in their hibernacula and
temporary shelters. Chiggers are the most common ectoparasites
of the racers. Four species of the chigger genus <i>Trombicula</i> have
been recorded on racers from the Reservation. The racer is an
important host of the common pest chigger, <i>Trombicula alfreddugèsi</i>,
which often attacks humans. Most adult racers on the
Reservation and nearby areas carry the fluke, <i>Neorenifer lateriporus</i>.
In spring these flukes are conspicuous in the mouths of the racers,
but in late summer they are not in evidence.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
